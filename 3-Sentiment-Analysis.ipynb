    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

    "Let's take a look at the sentiment of the various transcripts, both overall and throughout the comedy routine."

       "[['In this 2023 comedy special, David Nihill humorously navigates the complexities of identity, cultural norms, and immigration. The routine starts with an amusing encounter at an immigration checkpoint, highlighting Nihill’s Irish heritage and the officer’s misplaced connection to it. Nihill then adopts a Latino identity as a comedic device to critique automated customer service systems. He cleverly connects Irish and Latino cultures, drawing parallels in their experiences, particularly around issues like immigration and religion, using humor to highlight these similarities. Nihill also addresses the evolving perception of Irish immigrants in America, blending history with humor. He reflects on the Irish journey from being a marginalized group to gaining a more celebrated status in American society. His narrative includes witty anecdotes about his family’s history and their unique assimilation into American culture, adding a personal touch to broader discussions on race and identity. Throughout the special, Nihill uses his background as an Irish immigrant in America to offer comedic insights on cultural integration, identity politics, and the immigrant experience. * * * [Immigration Officer] Next. Hey, how’s it going? Passport. Oh, you’re Irish? Yeah. I’m Irish me self. All right. My great-grandfather’s dog, Sparky O’Houlihan, came over on the boat 200 years ago. Oh. Yeah, it says here you’re a comedian. Yeah, sometimes. You’re not gonna make jokes about America, are you? No, that’d be crazy. Yeah, not my country. Well, welcome to America, my Irish brother. (passport stamping) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) Thank you. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. I am indeed from Dublin, Ireland, but I live in America now so I identify as Latino. (audience laughing) I had to start doing that to get through your automated customer service lines because the other options are no good, are they? Like the minute you call up, they’re like, “Thank you for calling. For English, press one.” I was like, I don’t wanna be English. (audience laughing) My people have been avoiding (resisting?) that option for about 800 years now. What else have you got? You just keep listening. It gets immediately better ’cause they’ll be like, (David speaks Spanish: para español, marque dos) I said, I’m in here and now these are my new people. (audience laughing) Yeah, that’s the beauty of this identify as whatever you feel like culture that we have at the moment. No one can even get mad about that. But I didn’t wanna shock my parents too much ’cause they don’t know they raised a Latino. (audience laughing) Yeah, so it is at least logical. Irish people, Latinos already emotionally connected. We both like drinking, dancing, fighting, mostly work in construction. (audience laughing) We are primarily Catholic, we love soccer, speak a whole other language, and have problems with immigration. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We’re already one people. But it makes my life a bit confusing now because I’m Irish, I’m sarcastically Latino, and I live in America so I have white privilege. Yeah, I never had that in Ireland. (audience laughing) So quietly confident I caught it here. I know, and that’s kind of ironic if you know your history, ’cause you’ll remember the Irish people when we first got here, we didn’t get the most privileged treatment. But that can get forgotten. If you’re treating history like a Netflix series and you just join in season six, you’d be like, well, it’s going great for the Irish, isn’t it? (audience laughing) Look at them over there with their shamrock shakes and their parades. (audience laughing) They used to be filth, now they have their own Spring Soap. It’s a real rags-to-riches story. It can get easily forgotten when we first came here, there were signs. They said no Blacks, no dogs, no Irish. I dunno what you did if you were a Black Irish dog walker. (audience laughing) You were not coming in. You actually had no immigration laws in America until one group of people turned up, Irish people, and you’re like, well, we gotta do something about these lunatics. And that’s how all your laws got written into being law, and we love seeing laws and finding a creative workaround. That’s kind of what it means to be Irish partially as well. Like, that’s nice. Doesn’t apply to us. We’ll find a creative and potentially fun way to get around those laws, and we did. We just started shagging all of you. All of you. (audience laughing) That’s why many of you are here tonight. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We did it indiscriminately, everybody got it. Black, white, pink, Cuban, Asian, Israeli, Palestinian, even English people. (audience laughing) Oh, we would’ve shagged the Queen if we got to her in time. Oh yeah, and with that strategy, we penetrated the very fabric of American society. We got to the point of 23 US presidents claim Irish heritage. And were so lovely when Obama said, I’m Irish, we all went, yeah, feck it. Why not? Go on. (audience laughing) Yeah, like nobody asked to see his birth certificate, you know? (audience laughing) Yeah, who would do that? That would be crazy. We had a picture of him drinking a pint of Guinness and we were like, well that’s good enough for us, Barack. You know, a lot of people were saying Hussein, we read O’Bama clearly. (audience laughing) It’s in the name, isn’t it? Clearly Irish. (audience laughing) We were delighted about the addition of such a cool character. That’s how we are, we’re a very welcoming country. We are so welcoming, we don’t even have a Chinatown. Yeah, we just let them live with us. (audience laughing) That’s a deep statement. Take your time. (audience laughing) If this woke society that we have that’s a little bit fake at the moment has rubbed off on you, you’ll be triggered right now. You’ll be like, (American Accent) “oh my God, I’m offended right now. I can’t put my finger on exactly why, but I will think about it tomorrow while I’m having a sensible vegan brunch option, and I’ll walk it off. I’ll cover my body in Lululemon merchandise, and I’ll grab my three legged rescue dog Murphy and I’ll just be dragging him along while carrying a four liter indestructible canister of water to stay fully hydrated while I’m listening to Terry Gross on NPR to keep up with issues of diversity, and I will figure out why I’m offended, I will.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I am glad you were here staring at me because we emotionally connected on that one, and sometimes people just knew and she’s like, oh, well that one’s clearly a reference to what he’s interpreting as a fragmented and sub divided society in America that likes to call itself a melting pot, but is realistically more of a charcuterie board. (audience laughing) You know, like it has all these wonderful exotic flavors, and then you keep making it worse by adding too many crackers. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You said it. (audience laughing) It’s a great contrast to Ireland when you think about it because we don’t have, as you rightly nailed on the head there, don’t have a Japan town Korea town, little Italy, Latin Quarter, little Bangladesh, little Armenia, or Chinatown ’cause we’re equally shagging our way into everybody’s family tree. And that’s just brought to you by 23andMe ’cause we are always in your results. (audience laughing) We’re always in there.',\n",
       "  ' If there’s no Irish in there, that’s a false negative. Just do it again. You know, treat it like an antigen test and just keep doing it until you get the result you’re expecting. There it is. And no matter where you think you’re from. You could be sitting there and you’re like, I’m definitely Black. And we’d be like, “Are you? Are you really?” (audience laughing) 38% of all African Americans have Irish heritage and that list is fantastic, and includes Colin Powell, Alicia Keys, Beyonce, and Shaquille O’Neill. (audience laughing) I don’t know how you missed that one. That’s a huge example. It’s in the name and everything. Irish and African cultures were so intertwined when we both came to America, that we shagged it out so frequently, together, we invented tap dancing. (audience laughing) Yeah, invented horizontally, done vertically. And that was just through the blending of those cultures, isn’t it? That went on to become jazz music. Irish and and Black culture always a bit connected. It goes all the way back to 1845 if not before when Frederick Douglass escaped slavery, became a famous anti abolitionist and said, I’m gonna go around the world and tell them all to be anti-slavery. I’m going to Ireland for four days. Got there and he went, oh they’re fine. They already know. (audience laughing) Yeah, he said Ireland woke as feck. (audience laughing) Now I’m paraphrasing. He didn’t really say that. I sarcastically inserted the word woke into his mouth because I mean, that’s become a bit of a fuzzy word these days. We don’t even know what it means. Some people like it, some don’t. I think it boils down to being nice, and Irish people we’ve been knocking that outta the park for a while, and Frederick Douglas, what actually he did say was “this is the first time in my life I’ve been treated as a man and not as a color,” and he stayed for four whole months. So, look at that. Irish people just way ahead of the curve on that one. (audience applauding) We’re pretty good. Just a bit of Black history for you ’cause we love it. You have Black history month here in February, we have it in October. So already there are 10% extra Black history in Ireland. (audience laughing) You went short, we went long. That’s what I’m saying. (audience laughing) At any moment, this show could descend into trivia. It is just ’cause I like trivia, but I never know how to feel about it in America ’cause I watch your news and you have two different versions of the truth. So which trivia am I meant to believe? To find out what’s going on in this country, I have to watch the Irish news. (audience laughing) ‘Cause I love a good bit of trivia. Like, Irish people famously friendly, yet slightly sneaky. Yeah, we invented or were central to the invention of the tank, the guided missile, and the submarine. Yet the most damage we ever did America is sending you our priests. (audience laughing) (audience howling) See, that really touched some of you. (audience laughing) Inappropriately. That’s the power of good trivia, ya know? We are connected to every culture. Many Latinos here tonight? (audience cheering) Ooh, I am surrounded. (David speaks Spanish: Vamos a hacer el show en español) seria mill de veces mejor, y dejar los gringos por afuera See, I really committed to learning that language. I love it. I said well I’m in the second largest Spanish speaking country in the world, and I wanted to commit to that language because I didn’t wanna get caught out by some Karen in Whole Foods one day. (audience laughing) You know, they’ll get you, she’ll be like, (American accent) “Oh my God, I saw your little skits online where you identify as a minority group that you are clearly not part of.” And I’ll be like, (Speaking Spanish) Karen, hjpta, . que largse hasta alla (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Oh, that would be very enjoyable, wouldn’t it? You just see her scurrying off to the Tesla to avoid a racial hate storm, and there’s nothing but a trail of confusion and goji berries behind her. When Irish people first came to America and we were like, hello, help us starving refugees. America’s like, all right, but you gotta fight in our war against Mexico. Well, that doesn’t sound like a great plan. Have you got any other programs for the refugees? (audience laughing) Because America always has a program for something, but no they didn’t and we ended up fighting against Mexicans and we were down there and we’re like, jaysus, we like these people. I don’t know why we’re fighting against them at all. We have a lot in common, they’re great fun. And then we saw the deal breaker, Latinas, we’re changing sides. (audience laughing) Yeah, we saw, we were conquered, and we came. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We did, we genuinely changed sides. We became the first country in European history to fight on behalf of Mexico. And that is the longest, yet most historically accurate way to say we also shagged our way into Mexico. (audience laughing) If you know your history of that group, they’re called the San Patricios. There’s a lot of cool things named after them to honor that connection between the two places. There’s a guy called William Langford from Wexford. Most people know him as Zorro. You didn’t know that Zorro was a sneaky Irish dude. The legend of Zorro based on a mildly illegal masked immigrant riding around doing nice things ahead of his time, and he was a skilled swordsman with a blatant disrespect for authority. Definitely Irish. Definitely. (audience applauding) Definitely, and we left a bit more modern evidence. You just go on Google images and you type boxing, and then you add the word Canelo. (audience laughing) And just have a look what comes back at you because you’re gonna see a world and Mexican boxing champion that’s suspiciously red haired. (audience laughing) Pasty white skin covered in freckles and his real name is Barrigan, an Irish name. So if someone could get that man of 23andMe result, we can claim another true champion. (audience laughing) We are connected, those cultures. Do you know where they differ a little bit from Latin people to an Irish people? Latin people are not as sneaky as Irish people. Like, you don’t even… In Spanish, do you know the word for sneaky? Where are me Latinos at? [Audience Member] Picaro. Picaro, they’re not agreeing with that over here. I heard an audible no over here. “sospechosa”. Not really, doesn’t translate. Isn’t this amazing? That’s the diversity we have in Chicago these days where an Irish person is confusing Latinos with their own language. (audience laughing) It’s a bit of a sneaky trivia one because there’s loads of slang words, but there’s no direct translation from English Spanish to the word sneaky. And yeah, it’s fantastically ironic ’cause if you’re Mexican and you’re kinda known for sneaking over the border. (audience laughing) And there’s no word for the thing that you’re doing. (audience laughing) I mean, are you just walking over an arbitrary line in the ground to, you know, visit your family or pick a few strawberries or maybe celebrate Cinco de Mayo? A festival created for you. And Americans are like, Hey man, you snuck in there. You’re like listen, that’s the past tense and irregular verb that I don’t have. (audience laughing) I’m just gonna keep walking until someone buys me a flight to Martha’s Vineyard. (audience laughing) Oh, that was snea',\n",
       "  'ky. I’m just delighted to be here. America one of the most positive places in the world you could ever be based anywhere, and just the opportunity just to talk to people like do this is fantastic ’cause we were without it for a while, and I always didn’t get to do it. When I actually first moved to America, the job I had I came on a diplomatic visa, and one of the first tasks they gave me was organizing the Irish president’s visit to Seattle and Vancouver, which was a huge mistake by someone in a position of authority. (audience laughing) They just overlooked all the red flags you’re seeing here this evening. And there was a guest list to do and they’re like, who’s doing the guest list now? They’re like, you are. And I was like unsupervised. I invited everyone I ever met. I was like. (audience laughing) I was in Seattle and me uncle lived there. He’d moved from Ireland years ago and I forgot he’s so big, he’s 6’5 that he grew up, when he was 17 years old, he drove a mini Cooper from the back. (audience laughing) And he just removed the front seats for extra leg room. So he’s pretty sizable. You’re not gonna miss him, and he got so emotional during the president’s speech and my boss had told me, only C-suite level executives or above. And he worked in the logging industry and I went, well, close enough. (audience laughing) Gotta invite him, can’t miss out on this one. And he got so emotional during the speech he decided to rush the stage that he wanted to hug the president. Yeah, I dunno if you’ve ever watched your career changed live. (audience laughing) It was him moving towards him, oh no. And the Secret Service were there, but they were on low alert because Irish people, we never did it. (audience laughing) It’s a fairly unique group of white people in history where you’re like, well what did they do? We’re like nothing. We’re good actually. And you might correctly say, well, didn’t you blow up some British people? And we’ll be like, yeah, but historically, who hasn’t wanted to do that? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You can’t even invite those fellas to a tea party, can you? But no, we did make one bit of a fauxpas. When Hitler died, only one country sent condolences. Yeah, Ireland. (audience laughing) Yeah, how bad does the prospect of continued British rule have to be that we’re like, well, we better hedge our bets on this one. Somebody send them some flowers and tell ’em we loved his painting. Get ’em over there. But normally, we haven’t done it, whatever it is. And that applied here because they were on low alert. My uncle is moving rapidly towards the podium completely unobstructed. He gets there, grabs the president in a kind of a bear hug and he’s so big she just disappears into his body. My boss elbows me in the ribs and is like, “David, who the feck is that?” I said, “I have no idea.” (audience laughing) And at that moment he kinda leaned forward and was like, “David, get the camera. Get a picture.” Yeah, and that’s why I do comedy now. (audience laughing) I never planned on it. America, I blame Americans. It’s just too supportive with stuff. You can have the worst plan over here and Americans like, “you should try that. That could be a great journey for you. I’d love to see that.” And, you know, you do get the feeling when you move to America that anything’s possible and I got talking to this girl drunk as a monkey on St. Patrick’s Day, and she was kind of waddling towards me in a green shirt and it was made by Bed Bath and Beyond of all places. So pretty classy stuff we’re talking here, and it was a bit controversial. They genuinely were making these because it said on it, everybody loves a drunken Irish slut. That is not true. (audience laughing) Not even Irishmen love drunken Irish sluts. (audience laughing) That’s why we’re here. (audience laughing) For your drunken American ladies. And if we get lucky, maybe we’ll end up in your Bed Bath and Beyond. (audience laughing) But this one, drunk as a monkey, and it was that classic American conversation starter that scares foreigners. Like, what do you do? What’s your job? What do you do? I’m like, all right, take it easy, drunken lady. I didn’t really wanna tell her. So I was like, you know the Antarctic where it’s cold and is ice and snow everywhere? And she’s like, yeah. And I was like, “Because it’s ice and snow everywhere, it can be slippery and they have penguins walking around, loads of penguins. And I was like, sometimes ’cause it’s slippery, the little penguins, well, they fall over. I stand them back up again.” (audience laughing) I didn’t think she was gonna believe that one. I gotta tell you it was a magical moment when she called her friend. She’s like, “Oh my god, Megan, you’re not gonna believe. (audience laughing) The Irish guy, he’s a penguin stander upper.” (audience laughing) I was like, wow, anything is possible in this country. (audience laughing) But everything is accumulation of factors. I had time after that, a friend of mine tragically suffered a spinal cord injury and all his American friends were rallying around to do fundraisers for him to get him back on his feet. And they kind of rubbed off on me and I was like, oh, I wanna get involved here. What can I do? And they’re like, oh, could you host an event for us? You love talking, you’re always talking. I’m like, no, no, this was long before I’d ever did comedy. I was like, I’m afraid of public speaking. Actually most Irish people hate it, I’m no different. I hate public speaking. For me, it’s actually a crippling fear. And he said, I’m in a wheelchair, you dildo. (audience laughing) I was like, you’re right there. You have a fair point. It’s not a crippling fear. I’m gonna have to try and get over this. That is a terrible phrase. And so I started trying to do it and I started doing comedy. We ended up doing a fundraiser, we kept it going for years, and I ended up going down a bit of a rabbit hole of trying to raise money for people with spinal cord injuries because of our friend who was affected by it. And I was trying to be all business cool, you know, from what I learned with the government sending emails, you write kind regards all the time, don’t you? Like some days you’re being lazy and you’re like, I don’t need to be kind today. Just regards kind of a day. (audience laughing) Unfortunately, I’m dyslexic and every time I wrote the word regards, I put a T instead of a G. Some of you way better at spelling than I am, and I was not writing regards anymore. It was re, all right, but it was not regards. And sometimes I just dropped kind and went re not-gards to people with spinal cord injuries for two whole years. Nobody brought this to my attention in two year period. And now we live in a society where they’re like, that word’s not acceptable anymore. And I’m like, I fully agree. The only problem is I have documented evidence that I used this word. (audience laughing) I wanted just a hole to open in the ground and just disappear into it and I was like, I’m never making a mistake like this again. ‘Cause when you’re dyslexic you make a lot of them, and I was like, I can’t make one again. And a friend of mine sent me a message. He said, I know you’re thinking about moving to Los Angeles. Do you want to try out apartment here for a month totally for free, blah, blah, blah, something about a cat. And yeah, I’d lived in America long en',\n",
       "  'ough to know that free is my price point. (audience laughing) I didn’t need to read anymore, and that was a bit of an error of judgment because my companion in his apartment was Doug the psychopathic cat, and Doug had some interesting hobbies. His main one was pouncing from the darkness and stabbing me. (audience laughing) Oh, he loved a bit of stabbing. Any exposed piece of skin was fair game. He was just drawn to exposed skin, and I’d even give him a bit of neck and he just out the corner. What the hell’s this cat hanging there like Alex Honnold just hanging off a cliff face. Free Soloing off my ear lobes. I was like, this can’t get any worse, and then it did ’cause I got COVID about four weeks before it was fashionable. And because your US medical system is so crap, I had no idea what was going on with me, and I’ve lived in America long enough that I know you guys are great at turning a negative into a positive. So I always try and put the positive on something, and it is with the medical system. It’s equally one of the only countries in the whole world that you can just go online and diagnose yourself and prescribe yourself medical marijuana for fairly questionable medical reasons. (audience laughing) And you can get that delivered to you by a socially awkward person on or in an electrical vehicle, and then you just add Chunky Monkey ice cream and you’re like, whoo, I am better already. (audience laughing) I don’t even remember what was wrong with me in the first place, and that was the treatment I was doing with myself. And I was there locked with this cat, and unfortunately, the bathroom was separated from the bedroom by a hallway. So to get to the toilet, I had to run the gauntlet of Doug the psychopath. Yeah, and I dunno, now obviously diarrhea, it’s disgusting and who wants to talk about bodily functions ever. But it was a bit of a part of COVID now, and you’ll know if you really need to go and you haven’t got control, the preparation for going does not happen when you get to the actual bathroom. The minute you hear something funky, you’re running and you’re already dropping the pants. I was outta the door and I was in preparation mode, and that was a huge error of judgment. I was like, how can I make diarrhea and COVID worse? I’m just gonna add a short-haired tabby hanging off my private parts like a furry kettlebell dragging along behind me. I didn’t think it could get any worse, and the only respite I got from Doug was to barricade myself in the bedroom into what i thought was safety. But I forgot the little nut job used to love eyeing up the little quarter inch gap under the door, and I grew up with cats. I never had a cat do this. He’d just lie on his back and he’d just slide in under like a mechanic going in underneath a car, and he’d extend his little psychopath paws in under the door and just start playing an imaginary air piano just all night long doing his best Stevie Wonder impression from the darkness. I didn’t see his cat size claws for 14 days. I didn’t even know quarantine was a thing, but that was my quarantine. I finally escaped from that into the month of March (2020), and that was the first march in history that Corona Trumped Guinness. (audience laughing) Irish people did not see that one coming along with a lot of the rest of the world, but now I had a bit more time on my hands than was expected ’cause I couldn’t hang around with you lovely people. So I said, you know what? I’ve been hearing about Game of Thrones for ages, and I have all this medical marijuana for non-medical reasons. I’m just gonna combine the few of these and just see how it goes for awhile. And I was so stoned watching Game of Thrones that I started making correlations that clearly are not reality. (audience laughing) I decided Jon Snow, the main character, was the history of the Irish in America. (audience laughing) I dunno how I’m the only one seeing this, but every episode he’s talking about the weather. Every episode. Winter is always coming for Jon over there. At the start, everybody thought he was a bastard, didn’t they? And then they didn’t like him at all and they forced him to defend the walls that he had nothing to do with building, and fight against people that he had no beef with whatsoever. Sound familiar, Latinos? And they’d point out groups to him and say, Jon there the Wildlings over there. We don’t like that group of people and he’d be like, “Ah, I kinda like ’em. I specifically like that red-haired one over there.” (audience laughing) He had shagged her within a couple of episodes in a cave. And in doing so, united those groups of previously fighting people, and it’s just from shagging. And then of he went south and they said, Jon, we don’t like that group here either. They’re the Targarians. And he said, well same thing again for me, I kinda like one of them. There’s a good looking one over there. And they’re like, Jon, she’s so feisty. She has a fire breathing dragon. That’s pretty Latina when you think about it. And then he shagged her, didn’t he? And he united those tribes, and then they dug up more information. They said, Jon, we’re starting to like you. We did some research. One little thing, you’re not a bastard anymore. We know who your family is. You’re currently shagging your auntie. Yeah, you might wanna stop that. And he’s like, no, I gotta unite the tribes. I’ll keep going. And he did, and he brought ’em all together and now they’re all together. They love him so much that they decided we gotta make Jon the king, and in the end they gave him back the one thing he always wanted the most, the North, which is pretty representative of the Irish issue when you think about it. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You might be rightly asking, how long did he waste of his life to come up with that one? And that was 70 hours and 14 minutes. Oh man, and then when I ran out TV, I ended up like a lot of the world, you do a bit of scrolling on TikTok. It just came out and you’re like, ooh, what can I find here? And I was delighted I did because I found this beautiful 21 year old Black girl from Virginia called Morgan Bullock, and she was doing Irish dancing to Megan Thee Stallion music. The greatest thing I’ve ever seen. That’s our national dance, but with natural rhythm. (audience laughing) We’ve been missing that for a while. And somehow we got famous, despite the obvious handicaps for natural rhythm for dancing. We commercialized it, we created a show called “Riverdance,” sold out to 25 million people around the world despite only moving from the waist down in an in and out gyrating shagging motion. And then you’re shocked when we end up in your 23andMe results. I thought this dancing is fantastic. Let me enter the chat and just have a look and read the comments. It must be very nice. And all of a sudden it wasn’t. And they all said the same thing. “Oh my god, that’s cultural appropriation.” Yeah, some Becky in Berkeley, California who couldn’t get an acai bowl for breakfast that morning, and was angry at the internet about who knows what on behalf of a country that she wasn’t from. There was a lot of them. All the comments came from one particular country. You might know it ’cause we’re here now. (audience laughing) None of them were from Ireland because we know that you cannot appropriate Irish culture. You can appropriate other cultures, but not Irish c',\n",
       "  'ulture. It’s impossible. 35 million Americans claim Irish heritage. Between 50 and 80 million people around the world identify as Irish. That means we’re the largest per capita diaspora in the whole world, and we only have 5 million people in Ireland. (audience laughing) You Americans, you love joking about an Irish goodbye and an Irish exit. Clearly, we’re not pulling out. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We are in there ’til the end. But there was all these negative comments all of a sudden all from the same thing. Now luckily, entered the chat, the half Indian gay leader of Ireland. Because while you’re talking about diversity, we’ve been living the brand and, you know, stereotypes are a bit of a thing sometimes. So when I say over here we had half Indian gay leader of Ireland, they’d be like, “oh my god, you had an affluent Indian man in charge of your country? I bet he was a doctor. Those people are always doctors.” I’m like, yeah, he was a doctor, and his dad was a doctor, and it was a pretty good time to double down on doctors during a global pandemic. In contrast to your rather interesting leadership choices. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I mean, I don’t wanna cite probability, but one of those leaders way less likely to grab you by the pssy, you know? (audience laughing) I’m pretty sure that was our half Indian gay dude. They’d be like, go on grab her by it. No, no, no. Good, you’re in charge now. (audience laughing) ‘Cause if you wanna shut up a bunch of predominantly white people getting angry about cultural appropriation, which we know can’t be done against Ireland, and you wanna silence them, there’s nothing more effective than a brown faced gay dude who’s the leader of a predominantly white country in the past to enter the chat and say, shut the feck up. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That’s… I’m paraphrasing there. He wanted to keep his job so he said it in a nicer way. He said, “Morgan, well done. We love your dancing so much so you should come over for St. Patrick’s Day to Ireland and dance.” And she said yes, and this young girl flew over to Ireland and they did a radio interview with her, and unknown to anyone, they had a surprise caller during that interview. And the guy called in, he said, “Hey Morgan, head of “Riverdance” here. We’d love you to be the first Black dancer in the 25 year history of “Riverdance. What do you say?” And she said, yes. The best part of that story by a mile is that her first ever show in America as a Black Irish Riverdancer was in Salt Lake City, Utah. (audience laughing) Was right there Under the Banner of Heaven. (audience laughing) We had a young Black American lady helping to shag our way into the very fabric of Mormon society and God, that is Cultural Appreciation, isn’t it? Which is a much better term. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) It’s a good one. (audience applauding) A really cool story though, and if you get a chance to see her doing Riverdance, she’s on tour the moment. Go see it. But I was at a stage where I was like, you know, I was wasting my life basically. I watched “Game of Thrones,” now I’m TikTok scrolling away, I survived Doug the cat, but I’m not doing any productive. And a friend of mine’s like, “Would you not take some of your little comedy videos and throw them on the internet? Sure no one’s gonna see them anyway.” Yeah, that worked out a bit better than I thought, to be honest. ‘Cause my negative Irish self, and that is our natural demeanor, I was like, this is not gonna, what a waste of time. I hate social media to be honest. I never had any public social media really with any effort until two and a half years ago, and it took Americans to show me the positive of something I always thought was negative. And I was very glad you did because I got into a bit of trouble a few months after I started doing it. And I said something in Pittsburgh, that I don’t believe to be controversial at all. I said, and you might have heard me saying it, Irish people have no white guilt. None, and it’s due to a revolutionary strategy we had where we had potatoes in the ground and we all went, feck it, let’s pick ’em ourselves. (audience laughing) Over here. You, over here. Yeah, I’m not explaining that joke again, okay? (audience laughing) Yeah, if you don’t get that joke, you are the problem. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) But I was in the hotel that night after the show and I was heavily medicated for non-medical reasons, and I was eating ice cream in bed. I had a pot of Chunky Monkey and I had no challenges in the world at that moment outside of hand-eye coordination ’cause oh, I was so stoned I couldn’t get the spoon to my mouth anymore, and I could find the little lumps of fudge but I was basically flicking them over my shoulder. And chunk by chunk, I was turning the hotel room into a crime scene, and I just I was basically snorting fudge at one moment ’cause I just gave up on the spoon and I was like, I’m going in here. I’m like a horse into a feed bag of ice cream. And I dunno if you’ve ever been that messed up late at night and thought to yourself, you know what? This is a fantastic time for me to check my work email. (audience laughing) Yeah, I was like, oh I’m in tiptop condition right now. Let me just get a jumpstart on the working week right now. Oh, I was just lying stoned out my face with the little light, you know, on your face in the darkness with me fudge covered fingers scrolling away. And I was lucky I did because this message I saw kinda shocked me into a bit of sobriety. And it said, “You might be in a bit of trouble. Somebody badly misinterpreted something you said tonight. Click this link.” And it was a link to a TikTok video and I clicked it and the cover of the video said, Racist Irish comedian jokes about cotton picking. I said, well that’s definitely me. (audience laughing) Yeah, I looked at the view count. There was a hundred thousand views on this video. It’d only be up a couple of hours, and it was over 400 comments and they were all saying the same thing. Who is the racist? Where’s the racist? Where can we find him? I was so stoned, I entered the chat. (audience laughing) I said, I know where he is. He’s in a hotel room right now covered in ice cream. He had no idea he was a racist. This is a huge moment in his life right now, and it’s a big discovery. And to make things worse, he’s right now covered in an involuntary ice cream brown face. (audience laughing) Yeah, oh, I was just sitting there like a Canadian prime minister. (audience laughing) It was a PR disaster waiting to happen, and in a moment of clarity, I was like well geez, what am I gonna do? I nearly laid an egg, I’d never been that nervous in my life, and I was like, ooh, I have a little video from tonight actually. I can post what I actually said and feck it, I’m going to sleep and when I wake up tomorrow, it’ll be interesting at least. (audience laughing) And I know that doesn’t sound like a good strategy, and it wasn’t but I got a bit lucky I didn’t know with social media ’cause I’m such an idiot with it that when strangers write to you as a stranger, they don’t expect you to write back. Yeah, they’d be writing to me. “Hello, David’s team.” And I’m like, team? This fella can’t even work a spoon. There is no team. I am the I in this team. Like, there’s no way it’s you writing back.',\n",
       "  ' I’m like, no, those regards are all for you. I just… (audience laughing) Yeah, I just can’t spell. I didn’t mean it, but that’s a mark of authenticity. Just give ’em a love heart to try and make up for it. And so I didn’t know you’re not meant to write back. I’ve been writing back, I’ve been treating strangers like pen pals for about two and a half years. So you’re like, well you should come to Chicago and do a show and I’ll be like, yeah, well and here I am. That’s kind of how that works. (audience applauding) Hey, thanks. Well, thank you very much. I didn’t know there was any other way, but I guess because it was during lockdown and everything when it started, I guess it built up a little bit of goodwill. And when I was so heavily medicated that I couldn’t use words to defend myself, which is the one thing I meant to be okay at, given my current occupation, all these people started arguing on my behalf. When I woke up in the morning, they’d won. (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience applauding) This lady had fully retracted her statement, deleted the video, and made a public apology. And I was like, wow, that’s the world we really should live in, that I could go to bed totally racist and wake up totally cured. Like it never happened. So if you were one of those people that kicked into action on my behalf, thank you very much. I really needed you. That’s the core part of looking at everything positive I suppose, ’cause Americans, you are genuinely some of the happiest people in the world. You really are and you should be because you’re taking two thirds of the world’s antidepressants. (audience laughing) Yeah, you’re just going around with the Adderall fueled spirit of Ted Lasso running through your veins. Yeah, it really brings out your inner Trader Joe’s worker. (audience laughing) We’re not like that in Ireland. Ironically, my last name is Nihill, and that’s my real name as in nihilism, which among many other things means extreme pessimism. And I got that name from my dad and it’s ironic ’cause he is the most positive person I think I’ve ever met. Nothing gets him down, and a few years back he got diagnosed with cancer and on receipt of the diagnosis from the doctor, he looked so upbeat that the doctor was taken back and he’s like, “Mr. Nihill, I don’t think you realize the severity of the problem you have.” And my dad said, “I don’t have a problem. I just gave it to you.” (audience laughing) It was a pretty good strategy. He didn’t worry about it at all and a few years later, no more cancer anymore. Never came back to this day. I don’t think he ever worried about it for a minute. (audience laughing) That was great. Thank you. (audience applauding) He got a thing a wee bit later that many of our families are affected by sometimes and some of yours might be here tonight. Macular degenerative disease where your eyesight begins to rapidly deteriorate. He didn’t let it stop him at all. He’s like, “David, I’m off to renew me driver’s license.” (audience laughing) I dunno if that’s a great plan. And one thing played to his advantage that always happens to us as Irish people when we move to America. You get a really warm reception here, which is fantastic and American’s normally take a minute or two but you always know it’s coming where they’re like, “Oh my God, you’re Irish? Do you know my friend Brian Murphy? (audience laughing) He’s also Irish.” We’re like oh, I cannot wait to not know Brian Murphy. (audience laughing) It happened me with a guy called Dave Ryan in San Francisco. My friends were like, “Oh my God you’re from Dublin? My buddy Dave Ryan’s from Dublin. You guys are gonna know each other for sure.” And I’m like, dude, it’s 1.5 million people in Dublin. It’s statistically improbable. Then I met him and I was like, “Oh feck, Dave. I haven’t seen you in ages.” (audience laughing) To make it even more stereotypical, we worked in the same bar together in Ireland. (audience laughing) And his cousins live next to my auntie and uncle in a rural field in the middle of nowhere. There’s like 20 houses, and they just happened to live next door to each other. And it kind of played to my dad’s advantage a bit, the small world nature of Ireland ’cause when he went to renew the driver’s license, he walked in and he was all nervous and straight away the guy’s like, “Oh, Pat Nihill, haven’t seen you in years.” And oh he’s like, “What are you here for?” Oh, to renew it, and how’s your eyesight? My dad said, “It’s not great, to be honest.” And the man went, “Well, I tell you Pat, would you you see a bus if it drove past you?” (audience laughing) Yeah, my dad went, “Oh feck yeah, definitely.” And he went, “Good man, Pat. Three more years. Go on. (audience applauding) On your way.” (audience applauding) I dunno where he drove to, but he drove somewhere. A week later, God love him, he entered a golf competition. He loves golf and he entered a golf competition against people who could actually see their balls. (audience laughing) Yeah, and at one moment he pulled back the club and he went to hit the ball with all his force, and it exploded because it was a mushroom. (audience laughing) He wasn’t deterred by this whatsoever. He actually came second in that competition. (audience laughing) It was his highest finish in 15 years. And he was so excited about the whole confusion mushroom incident that he grabbed his 82 year old giggling friend and went back the next day to recreate the moment on video. He literally just voluntarily blew up a mushroom all over his own nut bag, and his friend videoed it and they did giggled like teenagers and then emailed it to me and went, “David, will this go viral on TikTok or what?” (audience laughing) Legend. He loved golf but I went, you know, golf is obviously hugely popular in Ireland. I got forced into some of the more extreme sports when I started traveling around the world, especially here in America. They love just doing unnecessary outdoor crazy stuff and I said, well I’ll try that. I started off with wakeboarding. Have you ever done that? It’s where they drag you behind the back of a boat like a modern day Red Bull sponsored extreme Jesus, and they waste as much gasoline as humanly possible. Yeah, it would’ve been fun, I suspect, but I didn’t really get to fully live it at the time initially because you’re just meant to pop up outta the water and slide across the top of the water. That’s it. I didn’t pop up at all. I just got dragged underwater like a leaky human submarine. It was dragging me around in figures of eight underwater with just water going in one hole and out the other. Yeah, it was like a high speed clonic irrigation, and I tell you wakeboarding one thing to know if you don’t stand up, it quickly becomes waterboarding. Yeah, Americans are great at that as well. (audience applauding) Not your fault. Spanish invented it, you perfected it, we never did it. That’s just a trivia cycle to that one. But I was so bad at wakeboarding that I jumped off the back of the boat at one moment, looked at my knee and part of it was missing, and it was all blood in the water and it was around the time in that flesh eating bacteria. Do you remember that was a thing in America and around the world before we moved onto COVID and forgot that flesh eating bacteria was a thing? Yeah, and they thought I might lose my knee and I ended up in hospital. My leg grew swelle',\n",
       "  'd so big it just kept bigger and bigger, and they start pumping you full of Vancomycin. And if you know anything about your drugs in America, you’ll know Vancomycin is the drug of last resort. When they give you this, the medical system basically saying eh, we don’t know. It’s a bit like the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) It’s like go on, take this, keep us posted. Maybe mix it with something down the road. And I say that as someone who took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in Miami in Spanish ’cause we’re pretty sneaky, and that was the only way I could get it at that time. But I ended up, I was pretty compromised in hospital and they wouldn’t let me out unless I had full-time medical care, which when you combine comedy and your insurance system, well, that was not gonna work out well. My mother had been a nurse her whole life and I couldn’t think of anyone better to ask to look after me. The only problem was she hadn’t traveled in like 20 years. I had to call her from San Francisco back to Ireland, and I was like ma’am, I really need you. Any chance you’d come over? And she’s like, “Absolutely, David, I’ll be over. Now I don’t know anything about flights or the internet or any of that carry on. I haven’t really been anywhere in about 20 years, but feck it, I’ll get back to you. I’ll figure it out. Don’t you worry about a thing.” Yeah, didn’t hear from her until the next day. She’s like, “David, I went to the bank. I met a beautiful Brazilian girl down there. She knew about the internet. Have the tickets. I’ll be over tomorrow. Thank God for the immigrants, huh?” (audience laughing) I don’t know if you know, nice little bit of trivia that Brazilian Portuguese is actually the fourth most spoken language in Ireland at the moment. Rapidly moving towards third most spoken language, and it’s kind of a very reflective immigration policy we had where we looked at ourselves in the mirror and we went, well Jaysus, we get sunburn pretty easily, don’t we? And we have no natural rhythm and, you know, we’re not exactly sexual icons and we haven’t qualified for the World Cup of football (soccer-yuk) in years. Brazilians, yes, yes, Brazilians. (audience applauding) How many is too many? Never. Keep it going. We’ve got loads of room. We used to have 8 million people in Ireland. We don’t even have five point something million now. So that’s room for a lot of Brazilians if you need them. And I’m totally fine with that, but I was very grateful of it. Me ma’am basically arrived the next day and it was funny ’cause it’s Irish people we take so long to get used to the rules in America. Like when we move here as foreigners you have to adjust to Americans’ love of the rules. You love the rules. We have ’em in all our countries, but they’re guidelines. (audience laughing) You know, you apply logic and you go your own way, and you can really see love of the rules if you participate or watch any American sport. You love it, the commentary is 90% about the rules, and the rest of the time is just whatever the athletes tend to be doing. I was watching the World Cup and they’re like here, “What have we got going on here, Ryan? Well, there was a foul in the box. It’s gonna be a PK. And what’s a PK for the viewers at home? A PK is a violation inside the box.” And for the rest of us in the world, Piqué is a Spanish player who used to shag Shakira, and then he strayed outside the box and that was a huge violation. (audience laughing) Confusing. But I didn’t know any of these rules until Americans dragged me mountain biking, and it will happen you. If you live in one of your predominantly white areas in America, four guys called Chad, Chip, Ryan, Carl, it’s normally a kind of four letter fraternity name, will turn up outside your house at about 8:00 AM on a Saturday morning while you’re trying to be hungover, masturbate, procreate, anything more productive than what they want you to do. They’ve got bicycles that are worth more than your car, and potentially house, and you can’t just join them. You have to first eat Goo packets and Clif Bars to sustain a false sense of sugar fueled enthusiasm to commute unnecessarily to a place you don’t need to be to do a thing you don’t need to do all while dressed as a ballerina. Very confusing. (audience laughing) Very confusing. I didn’t know it was called single track mountain biking and it’s where there’s only room for one mountain bike, and I didn’t know that Americans decided the person coming up the hill has the right of way. I didn’t know that, I was coming down the hill at speed. I was having a great time. I was like a dog hanging out of a car window. I was really enjoying it to be honest, and I was quietly confident the rules were on my side ’cause I was using gravity. (audience laughing) Yeah, technically a law for the Isaac Newton fans in the room. And the guy coming towards me, he thought the rules were gonna save him and that’s a classic American mistake right there. (audience laughing) Oh, you guys make it all the time. You’ll take some dude called Billy Ray in Alabama, and you’ll be like, “hey, that’s Billy Ray. He left high school at 11 years old, never actually read a book in his life, Billy Ray. Look at him there, he’s got his dungarees on backwards. He’s been surviving on nothing but Coors light and corn syrup. Billy Ray, would you like a firearm, huh?” (audience laughing) “It’ll be fine. He’s gonna follow the rules, aren’t you Billy Ray? Oh, yeah.” That’s not gonna work out for anybody. That’s what’s playing out here, but it’s just in mountain biking terms because it’s classic power versus authority. The only problem is authority only goes one way, downhill. You can’t use authority on your boss. It only goes one way. I’m coming down the hill, I have all the power, I am an idiot and a liability, but I have all the power simply because I have an outta control lump of steel supposedly under my control. And that is pretty representative of American society right there sometimes. (audience applauding) You can see it coming. This is no happy ending in that moment, and there wasn’t. And I knew this guy was American coming towards me ’cause he looked way too happy. (audience laughing) Oh, he was just an explosion of enthusiasm. It was like somebody combined 4-Hour Energy, Red Bull, and Viagra and gave it to a life coach on their birthday. (audience laughing) I couldn’t tell you what exactly what was going on in his mind, but if I had to guess it’d be like, “oh my God, I’m having the perfect day right now. There isn’t a cloud in the sky. I’ve never maintained such a speed at such an elevation game before. I could even be in a flow state right now. This could be a personal best for me. I can’t wait to get home and share it with my online community on Strava.” (audience laughing) Oh, I just crashed right into this fella, I took all the happiness off his face, and I could feel the Goo packets exploding on impact, and the peanut butter Clif Bars flying through the air. Oh, I smashed him. I took all the happiness off his face, and I hit him so hard, the two bikes got intertwined and my hand went through the crossbar and got locked there covered in blood stuck on his lycra clad testy satchel. His little Lululemon nut bag was in my hand. And I dunno if you’ve ever got your hand stuck somewhere, but you rock it. That is the technique. Yo',\n",
       "  'u always rock it. Oh, now I was arousing all the wrong forms of suspicion, and I went for an extra bit of leverage. Huge error of judgment. The excitement in his face only multiplied and I was like, Jaysus, now we’re more than strangers on a trail. How did I get into this? This is gonna be a negative online review somewhere. And it was real awkward ’cause we ended up just locked in this Mexican standoff, which is ironic. Mexicans smart enough not to be mountain biking in the first place. And I finally yanked me hand outta there, and we end up staring each other and he could have said anything. And there’s a moment of silence and he’s like, “Do you not know the rules?” (audience laughing) I was like, “Listen Carl, the rules are not gonna save you in this situation.” Okay, I shouldn’t even have a mountain bike. Billy Ray definitely shouldn’t have a firearm. So yeah, if you can get my hand off your nut sack, we can get out there, use logic, and make your country great again. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Yeah, that’s why I don’t do mountain biking anymore. But that was a bit of a long way to say, Americans love the rules. My mom shattered them the minute she came, she wasn’t even in America an hour and a half and they got to the hospital or she got to the hospital and was like, visiting hours are over. Feck they are, my son is in there. Straight in, no regard for visiting hours whatsoever, and we ended up all of a sudden in very close proximity ’cause they let me out only if she’d look after me, and we’re sitting in my house and we haven’t really lived around each other in a place different from my home in Ireland for years. Never been around that close, and and outta nowhere when she finally got comfortable after a few days, she was like, “David, do you have any of those cannabis cookies?” (audience laughing) I was like, “I do, I have loads of them actually.” And I fed her two, which was twice the recommended dosage and a grave error of judgment for getting your mother stoned for her first edible experience at 74 years old. And I know the problem was this was before COVID, so I wasn’t a weed professional yet because to be honest, I don’t like drugs. I’ve never liked drugs, but I love chocolate, and you Americans keep putting drugs in chocolate. Yeah, and then when you eat the drug chocolate, the regular chocolate tastes way better. Before you know it, you’re just in this chocolate consumption cycle. You’re literally like a stoned hamster lying at the bottom of the wheel watching the world go by until one day you wake up covered in chunky monkey ice cream in the middle of a racial hate storm on TikTok and you’re like, how did I get here? (audience applauding) Anyway, I got me mom stoned out of her ahead. Now if you know anything about Irish people, we take secrets to the grave, but that’s not the case on twice the recommended dosage. Oh, did she turn into a chatty Cathy all of a sudden. She’s like, David outta nowhere, “What do you think of gay marriage?” I said, what? And she’s like, nothing new to me, you know? I was the first lesbian in Ireland to get married in 1970. (audience laughing) Yeah, I was like, “Does dad happen to know about this?” Says it was his fecking fault. I said, “Please continue.” She’s like, “Well your dad couldn’t find his feckin birth certificate on the morning of the wedding. Now luckily we had his dead sister, Patricia’s.” I said, “Just hold on a second there, that’s big news. I never knew about that.” And she’s like, “Yeah, don’t worry about it. Your dad had a dead sister. She died when she was two. Not central here to the story.” (audience laughing) Yeah, I’m like that’s sounding pretty central to me ma’am, but okay. She’s like, “Well we couldn’t find Patrick’s birth certificate, but we had his sister, Patricia’s, and I didn’t wanna cancel that wedding. And the whole town knew the priest didn’t have the best eyesight. So technically and legally I’m married to your dad’s dead sister. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That’s a lot to unpack, isn’t it? And she just kind of moved on lovely from that as if it wasn’t a thing. Now she dropped one other crazy bit of information. I’ll tell you in a sec but the next morning she woke up and she had a new lease on life and she wanted to do walking for no reason, and that’s a bit representative of your elderly American people ’cause you’re out there with your snowshoes and you’re hiking poles, just walking up stuff for no apparent reason, right? Irish people not like that. If you take an elderly Irish person and you put them somewhere, that’s where they’re gonna be. (audience laughing) They live there now. But not her, the weed cookies gave her a bit of new lease of life and we’re in San Francisco and she’s like, “David, I think I’ll go for a walk to the Golden Gate Bridge.” I was like, “Well Jaysus, that’s kind of far. I suppose it’s downhill. Go on. Feck it. Why not? Give it a go.” (audience laughing) She did not come back for eight hours. (audience laughing) When she finally kicked in the door, came in, and I was lying on the couch with me leg elevated trying to get better with it. And she was like a giggling teenager. She said, “Oh David, look at these” Lululemon pants (audience laughing) Yeah, she kinda kicked out the hip and was like, “All the girls are wearing them. Does it make ass my look good?” It’s like, you haven’t even got an ass anymore. That thing’s like a bag of porridge back there. (audience laughing) She was having a great old time and couple of days in when I start getting better, she’s like, “David, I might give you a bit of space. I’ll go visit your uncle up in Seattle.” You know, the big fellow who hugged the president. Yeah, she goes up there, called me a day later, she’s like, “David, you’re not gonna believe where I am. I’m on a wakeboarding boat.” I said, there is no way you’re wakeboarding. She’s like, “Oh God, no, I’m not wakeboarding.” No, I have another thing. (Calling out) Rory, what’s it called? “I have a bong, David. (audience laughing) Oh, I am stoned out of my head. And your auntie’s here with me. I’m getting her stoned.” Oh, Jesus, my auntie used to be a nun. She married a priest. I don’t even know how that happened. (audience laughing) My mom started corrupting the whole family and after she nursed me back to health, she went away back to Ireland and I’ll never forget the message she sent me. It was lovely. It said, “David, I know we’re mother and son but now it feels like we’re friends.” Yeah, and I remember reading it going, this is a blue message. This is an iMessage? Did you get an iPhone? (audience laughing) Yeah, she’s like, yeah, goes well with me Lululemon pants. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Smiley face and everything. Well, she went back home and she was corrupting the way the family. God love my uncle got Parkinson’s disease, and none of the traditional medication was working. And my mother being a newfound West coast hippie, have we tried any alternatives here? Maybe a bit of CBD oil or something. So I dunno what they were doing to him, but at one moment the little old ladies were over for tea and they were in that corner and my uncle was in his chair ’cause that’s where they left him. (audience laughing) And he stood up at one moment and they were like, well where’s he off to? And he was shaking a bit and they’re like, oh, he’s gonna fal',\n",
       "  'l. And he started falling, my auntie tried to get to him in time but she didn’t make it. He started falling on top of my auntie. My mother kicked into action. Obviously the nurse in her jumped up, didn’t make it in time. My uncle fell on my auntie, and the two of them fell on my mother and broke her leg. Yeah, and my uncle was just lying there smiling ear to ear. No idea what was going on. And the little old ladies were mortified ’cause he was pretty much dead weight They couldn’t move him so they had to go in and get the next door neighbor to help, and he was famously a bit of a smart ass with a good sense of humor on him. She came in and he’s like, “Well Jesus, if this fella’s going out, he’s going out with a bang.” (audience laughing) Look at him, ex priest lying on top of two sisters, huh? They’ll be talking about this one in the town.” My mam was so mortified by this whole scenario that she lied to me and she said she broke her leg when she fell off the back step of the house getting some firewood, and I only know the real story ’cause Dave Ryan from San Francisco, his cousin lived next door. That was the guy. (audience applauding) We are always connected. (audience applauding) Yeah, we really are. But there was one, the part I enjoyed the most about this is there was a bit of a tangent to the story that my mother added before she went off on her wander to Golden Gate bridge the night before. And as immigrants in America or anywhere in the world, we usually have one thing in common. Someone in our families was illegal at some stage. They might not be talking about it. They might be here now keeping it on the quiet. Just with my family, I didn’t know it was my mother. Yeah, until I got her slightly stoned. So it turned out when I was a kid, she used to work as a nurse in New York and come over and back and send the family money, and she disappear for a few months and come back again. And I just thought she missed her kids, which I’m sure she did, but it was more actually she was coming home ’cause she was being thrown out in various manners, or sneaking back in again on a different visa, or not overstaying something. Now and you know tonight I told you Irish people were sneaky buggers. I dunno if you know we have Irish names. So my name in English, David Nihill, in Gaelic Irish, Daithi O’Nihill. And to your immigration system, that’s a whole new person. (audience laughing) We’ve been using that one for a few years, and my mother definitely was. And then she’d used up all these kinda little tricks, and she’s there telling me about it and she’s like, “David, I was kind of outta options and I was at a point where geez I just needed another passport and I’d used everything I knew and sure, I was thinking Jaysus, that day and age to get a passport at that time you only really needed an extra birth certificate. Yeah, I had an extra one of those lying around, didn’t I?” Back from the grave. (audience laughing) This is a lot to unpack and some of you will figure it out at different moments and that’s okay. That’s what happened to me, ’cause she just went on to the next part, and it turned out she was working in New York at one moment in time as a nurse nursing back to health a particular lady of interest who’d fallen and broken her hip. That lady was Donald Trump’s mother. Yeah, my mother as an illegal immigrant. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Was nursing back to health the mother of a guy competing on an anti illegal immigration mandate while traveling on the passport of a dead two year old. (audience laughing) Who she was also in an involuntary lesbian relationship with. (audience applauding) If that isn’t the most Irish American, potentially Latino, sneaky, maybe woke potentially gay story you’ve ever heard as brought to you by your US medical system, I don’t know what is. Thank you very, very, very, very much. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) Thank you. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) Thank you. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) Listen, you might be asking yourself these stories sound a bit bonkers. Was this fella just taken all of the weed himself and making them up? Especially in the case of my mother’s one, it sounds so outlandish. You’ll be like, is that true? And I’ll say for legal reasons, allegedly, it’s true. And also she warned me “you better not tell anyone about this feckin story, David.” She was pretty clear on that. So allegedly it happened. I dunno, you make up your own mind. But just so I’m off the hook, but I would love to show you one or two little characters before we get outta here ’cause I’m thinking it’s always nice to visualize something if you’re like, oh, I wonder did that actually happen? Have a look and see if you recognize this fella, or who he might be. (audience laughing) That’s Doug the psychopath. And he looks all cute, doesn’t he? And that is the definition of cat fishing when he got me. His little claws are already sticking out ready to go. And the reason I wanna share with you that is we live in a society where we’ve never processed so much information at a speed we’re not really capable of processing. So sometimes we miss things and in my case, that multiplies when you add being and a moron and dyslexic ’cause I had all the information I needed right here. This is the message my friend sent me about his lovely cat. “Just to give you a heads up though, he’s still a kitten and spent at least a couple of months on the street before we found him. He’s just been fixed, which seems to have calmed him down, but he does sometimes play with people by biting their wrists and ankles or pouncing from the darkness.” (audience laughing) “It’s never too violent and it’s never angry, and he’s mostly a sweetheart but just wanted to let you know that before you agreed to spend time in the house with him.” (audience laughing) Yeah, and like an idiot I wrote back, “Ha, no worries. Much appreciated.” (audience applauding) I had all the information I needed, and this really did happen to me working on the Irish President’s mission, and that is the only time you’ll ever see me in a suit. And that is Mary McAleese, one of the 21 years of female presidents we’ve had while you’re still thinking about it. (audience applauding) Might be time. (audience applauding) Now obviously I’ve called America home for a long time, and I love living here so I don’t wanna be too sarcastic. You have made great progress recently. You got a Black little mermaid. (audience applauding) And that was huge for you as a country. I mean, very divisive initially, but you pull together and you work through it. And meanwhile while you were doing that, we found a Nigerian lady and we made her mayor of the town of Longford in Ireland, and she never had to identify as a fish or anything. (audience laughing) Just straight to a senior leadership position. But you keep telling us about being diverse, and maybe we’ll catch up. And that sounds a little bit stabby but feck it, I’ve lived here long enough and you said “if you see something, say something.” (audience applauding) (audience laughing) But my boss hated me so much over this uncle grabbing the president incident that here already, they’re trying to squeeze me out of this photo. They’re genuinely trying to block me as much as humanly possible. Now my boss hated me so much over this incident, she spent every day t',\n",
       "  'rying to get me fired and I’m here talking to you guys doing comedy so she definitely won. But America rubbed off om me so much I start believing, well I could probably do anything ever since the penguin stander upper incident and Americans encouraging you to do things, they’re like, you can do anything. And I say, I might write a book. I have no idea what about but might right one. I’m a dyslexic idiot. I don’t think I ever passed any form of spelling test in my life. I’ve never nailed a captcha. I can’t even get on the wifi in most places, and Americans are like “don’t let that stop you. You can do it. Just one word every day. Do the morning pages. This could be a great journey for you. You do it, you go on it, you live your you” whatever motivational speech, and I start believing it and was like, you know what? If I get to write a book, I’m so annoyed by this boss thing trying to fire me when I really shouldn’t have been, that I’m gonna put in a chapter on management relations. If I ever write this book, even it’s a picture book, it’s going in there. I don’t care. And wouldn’t you know it Americans rubbed off on me. I went for it, I took the advice, I wrote a book, it got published in a couple of languages and here is that section on management relations. My old boss, Roberts Diane, I’ve spelled her name backwards to protect her identity. (audience applauding) (audience laughing) Genuinely, she had an intern with a government credit card go to a physical location with a physical photo and have them remove me from it. The 10% of me that’s actually visible, and then hung it back on her wall proudly. And nobody ever knew that story until now. (audience laughing) So, you know, some stories you wanna keep going. This one true also. So what is a racist comedian telling jokes about cotton picking is actually a person trying to make a very supportive statement about that Irish people were generally being well-behaved since 1845. In the words of Frederick Douglass, we’ve been knocking it outta park. Now that got a bit misinterpreted interestingly because there was no audio on the video that was posted. So everybody commenting on that and sharing it was trying me, judge, jury, and executioner, and not a single person stopped to go, “well what did that idiot say?” So if you were one of the people that stopped me squirting ice cream out of every available orifice in a moment of need, thank you very much. It was a moment of need. It’s the only reason I’m still doing comedy, so thank you. (audience applauding) Onto more positive things. Who do we think this is? Oh, that is my mother. That is said wake boarding boat. That is my cousin drinking Jack Daniels whiskey while wake boarding. That’s not how Red Bull imagined it to be done, and that’s my uncle that hugged the president, and in my mother’s hand is suspicious. (audience laughs) That is a gateway pipe to what became a bong later in the day, and she took upon corrupting my auntie who used to be a nun. (audience laughing) And because she used to be a nun in Ireland, as such a small world as we learned tonight, I’ve had to take precautions. (audience laughing) You think she’ll be okay with that? I dunno. (audience laughing) And you might say, did your mother really break her leg? That story sounded too crazy to be true. The crazy ones that the Irish ones, they’re always true. Look at her going there. Yeah, that was quite a break. And if you wanna see the evidence, she spent too much time on the west coast of America surrounded by avocados. (audience laughing) She ignored medical insurance and took to the magical healing properties of avocados, which is roughly the same price as medical insurance. Very unusual scenario. She recovered and she’s all good these days. So it had a happy ending. This one I love. That’s the half Indian gay leader of Ireland kicking into action to say, well done Morgan. We love your dancing. Basically shutting everybody up with all the negativity with something that was clearly positive and a connection of two cultures that are really intertwined going years back. And rather than giving out we’re praised her, brought her over to meet the president of Ireland and gave her an award for contribution to Irish culture. And that is how you appreciate culture, which is a much better thing. (audience applauding) And you might be asking yourself, well Jesus, this fellow’s been talking a lot about Ireland tonight all of a sudden. And I have been not just ’cause it’s where I’m from or ’cause I’m proud of it, which I am, but I think we’re a great example of a country that was thought to be backwards that suddenly went really, really forward. We were meant to be very white, and now we’re very diverse and multicultural, and we’ve done that pretty much seamlessly compared to a lot of the world. And at the end of the day, if I’m gonna spend my time doing comedy, I’d rather talk about things to unite us rather than divide us. So at the end of the day we can just be a bit nicer to each other ’cause realistically, well, we’re all a bit Irish, aren’t we? (audience applauding) At least a little bit. (audience applauding) And if you think you’re not, check your 23andMe results. Speaking of interesting things, who do you think this is? (audience laughing) Oh yeah. (golf club thumps mushroom) (audience laughing) 83 years young and still going strong. Thank you very much. You guys have been fantastic.

       " [\"[man] Can you please state your name? Martin Moreno. But you might know me as… Martinnnnn! I’ve been touring with Gabriel Iglesias for 20-plus years. Martinnnnn! And, yeah, he’s been screaming my name for 20-plus years. Hurry up, Martinnnnn! Dude, that’s better than most marriages. That’s a win. It has been an incredible journey. We’ve gone from garages, clubs, living rooms, to theaters, arenas around the world, and now a stadium. They say comedy is subjective, but when you’re selling out stadiums, that’s no longer subjective. So, what can people expect? One of the biggest shows Los Angeles has ever seen. And whatever you do, make sure you stick around till the end. You want to see how this thing ends. So, what else is left to say? Without further ado, live from Dodger Stadium, Gabriel Iglesias!

[crowd chanting “Fluffy!”] We did it. I didn’t do it, we did it. Thank you so much. Thank you so very… [in Spanish] “They want to cry.” “Yes, they want to cry.” I haven’t been out here 30 seconds and already… Thank you so much. Thank you. I know some of you just found out Martin is real. ‘Cause you finally get to see him, right? And if you’re Mexican, yes, he looks like Machete. Or Marco Antonio Solís. If you’re white, he looks like the Big Lebowski. Wow! This is awesome. Martin wasn’t lying, you guys. We started off in freaking garages and backyard barbecues and quinceañeras and weddings and… now it’s like, you know, this is… this is home for us. The biggest thing I’ve ever done will be tonight without a shadow of a doubt. And I’m glad that you can all be here for this. This is, uh… ‘Cause, yeah, after Covid, I wasn’t sure what was gonna happen. You know what I’m saying? Like, the only good thing I can say about 2020 for me was the fact that, for some reason, I managed to lose 70 pounds. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I lost 70 pounds. People ask me, “What’s your secret?” I said, “It’s no secret, they closed all the goddamn restaurants, that’s the secret.” I didn’t know how to cook. That was the secret. It was me at home with a Foreman Grill making wienies… But, yeah, we were on tour in Kalamazoo, Michigan, when we got the news that we had to go home. And then we came home, and we all turned on our TVs. And we watched them lie to us. I’m not trying to be a conspiracy person, but they told us, remember? “It’s only going to be two weeks.” That’s it, they told us, two weeks. Right? “Ladies and gentlemen, we’d just like to ask that you go home for two weeks, be with your loved ones, be with your family, just two weeks, while we figure things out.” “Dr. Anthony Fauci has given us some new information to go by.” “Just two weeks, that’s all we need, just two weeks.” And I apologize for using the same stereotypical old white voice. But that’s the one that they used. Because that’s the one we listen to in a time of crisis. It couldn’t be any other voice. It couldn’t be… [in Spanish and English] “No, man, shut up, look!” “No more than two weeks, okay?” “You gonna go home, go to your mama and your papa.” “And if Covid come to the house, you tell Covid, ‘Hey, he’s not here, buddy.'” “Come back another time, it’s okay.” “Just two weeks.” It couldn’t be any other voice. It couldn’t be… [as redneck] “I’ll tell you what, this is what you’re gonna do, God damn it.” “You’re gonna take your ass home, you’re gonna hunker down.” “You’re gonna hunker down and if Covid shows up at your front door, get her done right there to the face, okay, that’s what you’re gonna do.” “Just two weeks.” It couldn’t be any other voice. It couldn’t be… [as Black man] “All right, listen up, this is what’s gonna happen.” “You’re gonna go home, you’re gonna be with your family and them, right?” “And if…” oh, you don’t wanna laugh at the Black voice, huh? Whatever. That’s your guilt, not my guilt, I’m fine. I’m fine. But, yeah, just two weeks, that’s what they told us. Two weeks, and two weeks turned into two months, turned into half a year, turned into a year-plus. And little by little, they told us who was most at risk for Covid-19. Come to find out, it’s people over 45, okay? People who are overweight. Here we go. Diabetics. [in Spanish] No fucking way, really? Most at risk, Latinos and African Americans. Yeah. Bye, Felicia. I come to find out I was 85% of the underlying conditions. Over 45, overweight, diabetic, high cholesterol, high blood pressure. Apparently Covid is my Tinder match. Someone finally wants to swipe right, and her name is Corona. Yeah. The mask thing is still a thing. Some are for it, some are not. Some, you know, some places it’s required, some places it’s optional. Biggest complaint I have heard about the mask is that the mask smells funny. And I’m here to tell you, no, it doesn’t. You do. You are smelling what everyone has been telling you all these years, and finally you’re smoking what we’ve been smoking. Oh, yeah. I’ll be honest with you, my mask smells delicious. My mask smells like Oreos and tres leches cake, okay? If you smell my mask right now, you will Krispy Kreme yourself, it’s so good. I feel like selling it on the OnlyFans website to see if I can make some money. Some of you know what’s up? [in Spanish] You skank. This next thing I’m going to say is in no way, shape or form political. So, please, don’t take it that way. The vaccine. Look at some of you, “Oh, here we go.” “Here we go, I knew it was coming.” “I knew it.” “Look at him, he’s got ‘booster’ written all over him.” I’m not here to tell you what to do with your bodies, I’m just here to share a story. I got vaccinated, okay, and I’m not saying it to get approval. I’m just telling you because, hey, look, I was 85% of the underlying conditions. At this point, I’m rolling the dice. Plus, I wanted to work. I got the vaccine, but it was one of those things where, you know, in the beginning, when you wanted to get the vaccine, you couldn’t just walk into a CVS. You had to make an appointment. You know, and it was a drive-out, you couldn’t just show up. ‘Cause I tried. Oh, I tried using the face. I’m like, “Eh, hey, eh!” Apparently this only works at Red Lobster. Oh, yeah, I could show up at Red Lobster at eight o’clock on a Saturday, it’s on. “Do you have reservations?” “It’s Fluffy, make biscuits!” But for the vaccine, no, I made my appointment like everyone else. It was a drive-out location, you know. [imitates car revving, tires screeching] There’s a little speaker box. “May I help you?” This is very familiar. “Yeah, let me have… a large vaccine.” “Pfizer/Moderna?” “Uh, I got a coupon.” “Whatever’s free.” “Pull up to the window.” Then I pull up to the next window. And then a guy who’s all covered up, he’s got the whole, you know… [breathing loudly] Then you give him your arm, and then they harpoon you. And they make you park your car for 10 to 15 minutes in case you have an allergic reaction. So I’m sitting in the car and I got the radio going and the A/C going, and I glance over and I notice there’s people there protesting. And that’s fine. Protesting is a right, and I’m all for it, okay? My problem is when protesters leave the sidewalk and get right in your face. So here’s what happened. I glance over, I see the protestors, and I locked eyes with one of them. And I could do this all day, I’m in the car. I’m like, “What?” The lady who I’m looking at all of a sudden starts walking towards me. And I’m like, “Ah, shit.” She gets to my car and she starts going off on me. And I have never had a complete stranger go off on me for no reason at all. She gets to the car and she’s like, “You are so stupid! You are so stupid!” “How could you get the vaccine? How could you get the vaccine?” “You have no idea what you just put inside your body, dumb ass.” I didn’t know what to\",\n",
       "  ' say. I was like, “Bitch, I eat chorizo.” You have no idea what that vaccine has to work through in order to have any type of effect whatsoever. It’s got to go through years’ worth of chorizo, chicharrón, carnitas, carne asada, freakin’ hot dogs, bologna, Spam, menudo, caldo de res. It’s gotta go through the gauntlet. But, yeah, so, on top of that, you know, we’re trying to figure out this whole thing with Netflix and doing a new special. And during the pandemic, 2020 especially, there was not even a possibility of assembling a few people, much less a stadium. So, Netflix made it clear. “We need a new special sooner than later, okay?” This was right before… They didn’t have Squid Games yet. You remember… [chanting Squid Games melody] [in falsetto] “Red light!” Some of you are like, “That’s racist.” No, that’s accurate, that’s really good. So anyway, Netflix said, “As soon as there’s an opportunity to record a new special, we need a special.” So, with time going by, there became two options for recording a special in late 2020. One was Florida and the other was Texas. [scattered booing] Some people from Texas cheering, yeah? Okay, you can cheer all you want. That’s where I got Covid. Yeah. [in Spanish] Fucking slacker. So… So, here’s the story. So, I had done shows before in Texas, and I had never done a show in San Antonio, so the original plan was, we wanted to record a special in San Antonio for the new Netflix show, you know, for the series. So, we couldn’t really travel too much. And remember they kept telling us, “Stay in your Covid bubble.” “Don’t forget to stay in your bubble,” so, in order to be as proactive and just careful, we all went out there together as a team, okay, and then we all basically said, “We’re going to do a residency in San Antonio for 30 days.” “Thirty shows in 30 days, and on the last day, we’ll record a new special.” This way gives me a chance to start performing again because it had been over a year since I touched a stage. And so we get there and they gave me the option, “Do you want to stay in a house or do you want to stay in a hotel?” And I said, “Well, I’ve never lived in Texas before, so let’s see what a house feels like.” So they got us, like, this fancy Airbnb, and basically, you know, it was Martin, Alfred, my friend Rick, myself, it was four of us. It was like the Mexican version of The Real World, okay? So, we’re all in this big house together. Everyone gets their own room, and so, of course, I get the big room ’cause it’s me. And… you know. Look at some of you, “No!” Yes! So I open up the door, I turn on the light… click! And I’m like, “This is a beautiful room.” “Wow! Look how big it is.” And then I notice there’s a hole in the wall. I said, “That’s weird.” So I get really close to the wall, and when I got close, I realized it’s not a hole, it’s a big-ass roach. And let me tell you, I am not exaggerating when I tell you that cuca was this big. That roach was this big. Now, I have used this unit of measure before to exaggerate, and I’m not exaggerating when I tell you that freakin’ cucaracha was this big. And I don’t want you guys thinking, “You think you’re too good for roaches?” No! I grew up with roaches my whole life. My mom and I, we lived in apartment buildings, projects. We always had roaches, but they were different. First of all, they were this big. And California roaches are very different, okay? For example, when you turn on the light, they scatter. In Texas, he chilled. In California, they respond to sound and movement. “Haaaa!” “Scatter!” I tried my California technique on this Tejano roach. I said, “Haaaa!” And the roach was like, “What?” Oh, my God, I don’t think he’s in my room, I think I’m in his. And at that moment, my tour manager walks in the room, and she’s like, “Is everything okay with the accommodations?” I said, “No, the room is beautiful, but, um, look at the wall.” “Aw, there’s a hole in the wall!” I said, “Get closer.” She gets up to the wall and she’s like, “Oh, it’s a big-ass roach.” I said, “You’re okay with that?” She said, “He’s not in my room.” She can see that I’m visibly bothered by this roach, so she’s like, “Would you like me to take care of your little friend for you?” And it is a little emasculating, because I’m a big guy and she’s like 5′ 2″. So she’s like, “Move, fool.” She takes off her shoe, she grabs it, she gets up on a chair, and she brings it back and she’s like, ♪ Soy la 69 ♪ Bam! Nailed that roach. Threw down her shoe, put it on. I look at the wall, and it kept moving. And I said, “You have angered our friend.” And she was defensive. “Uh-uh, fool, round two!” So she grabs her shoe, gets back up on the stool, and she brings it back, and just as she’s about to nail this roach for the second time… that shit started flying. It was a Harry Potter roach! Oh, man, look, look, look! She’s ñañaras, man. So anyway, we were there for 27 days. And for some reason, on the 27th day, out of a team of 30 people that were there to film a special, I was the only one that tested positive for Covid-19. No one else got it. Not Martin, not Alfred, nobody. And I told Martin, “Dude, I don’t know where I got it.” And he said, “I think you got it from the roach.” Anyway, on top of dealing with Covid… and, by the way, a sincere apology to the city of San Antonio because I was supposed to tape a special with you guys, and clearly for obvious reasons we couldn’t do it. But I hope you understand why I had to do this tonight. [cheering] On top of dealing with Covid, the vaccine situation, I come to find out someone was trying to extort money from me. Yeah, and they weren’t even family. [in Spanish] So, suck it. Watch. I get a phone call from my manager telling me that someone reached out claiming to have video footage of me being “inappropriate” with models. Yeah, see? Look at ’em. You guys are like me. Yeah, I’m like, “I need to see it too.” Now, no disrespect to any woman who has ever given me the opportunity. But none of them were models. Maybe a couple of cochinas from West Covina, maybe. But they were not models. They were just good citizens. Thank you. So, anyway, they said I had until 9 a.m. to make a deposit of $50,000 into an account or they were going to release the footage to TMZ and my career was going to be over. When I got the message, it was already 6 p.m. So I had missed the deadline by half a day. So I was like, “Let me turn on the TV, see if I still got a job.” And clearly this is the first time you guys are hearing about this because there was no footage. They were just trying to scare me into giving them money. The only reason why I’m telling you the story is because… only 50,000? Like, seriously? That’s what my career is worth? Don’t get me wrong, when I said $50,000, some of you were like, “Oh!” And it is a lot of money, but if you’re going to go after a celebrity, $50,000 is really low. Like, to put it into perspective, they did the same thing to Kevin Hart. And with Kevin Hart, they hit him for ten million. Ten million. Which lets me know where I stand on the comedy totem pole of success. There’s Kevin Hart with ten million, and I am like the Groupon of extortion. “Where’d you get your extortion?” “Got that shit at Ross on clearance.” Fifty thousand dollars. You can’t even buy an Escalade with $50,000. That is like a Hyundai Sonata at best, okay? And that’s like a base model. You still gotta do this shit to the window, you know? Fifty thousand dollars? But… on a more happier note, I did manage to stay busy during the pandemic. I did a movie from my living room. Yeah. And it wasn’t even on Pornhub. The movie already came out in theaters. It was called Space Jam, it’s the movie with LeBron. Los Angeles, you are looking at the new voice of Speedy Gonzales. [cheering] Thank you. I found it ironic that they hired the slowest Mexican to play the fastest, you know? And two weeks after I get this part, I come to find out that they’re trying to cancel Speedy Gonzales. I’m sure some of you heard that they came after two cartoons. They came after Pepé Le Pew and Speedy. Now, Pepé I understand. He’s a little touchy. You know, but he disguises it with a “Oh-oh, mon chéri.” “Oh-oh-oh!” “Mon chéri. Oh-lah-oh-ohhh!” Yeah. But Speedy Gonzales, what’s his crime? He’s Mexican and he’s fast. That is not a crime. In Montebello, that’s called job security. So I said, “I cannot let them hurt Speedy,” you know. “I can’t let them cancel him.” So I came to his defense. Plus, it was my only job. I went to the only place I felt I cou',\n",
       "  'ld go to protect him. I went on Twitter. And Twitter, ooh, Twitter’s a scary place. It is. You only go there to fight, to get into it, to prove a point, and so a friend of mine said, “If you want to get some attention, use a hashtag,” and so I did. And I wrote a tweet that said, “Hey #cancelculture.” “My name is Gabriel Iglesias, and I’m the new voice of Speedy Gonzales.” “You cannot cancel or catch me.” And I posted it. I had no idea that when you go on Twitter looking for problems, you will find them. Oh, yeah. Every major news outlet picked up my tweet and used it in a story about cancel culture. ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN. If I would have known that, I would have used spellcheck. ‘Cause my family called. [in Spanish] “What, are you stupid? Spell correctly!” Oh, my God. Even Fox News did a story with my tweet. Fox News. You know how I know? My bus driver Dave called me. Oh, he was thrilled. He was like, “Fluffy, God damn it, I’ve never been prouder.” “You made it, baby. You’re on Fox News.” I said, “Dave, shut up, you’re stupid.” He’s like, “America.” Even Warner Bros. Pictures reached out to say thank you, and before I know it, I was on a Zoom call. And I know a lot of us had to get used to Zoom, and it’s kind of convenient, right? All they see is this. So to entertain myself, every time I took a Zoom call, I was full Winnie the Pooh. And if you’re not laughing now, you better ask someone who is, ’cause there is no coming back from full Winnie the Pooh. I was leaving baby powder all over the house. It looked like an episode of Narcos. So I get on the Zoom call with the director, writer and producer of Space Jam. And they’re being super nice, super supportive, super cool. They’re like, “Gabriel, thank you so much for lending your voice talents to our film.” “We really appreciate you being part of this.” “If you have any questions or concerns, let us know.” So, “Thank you.” “We have a question for you.” I said, “Okay.” “How do you feel about the voice of Speedy Gonzales?” I said, “Well, what do you mean?” “Well, you know, some people find him to be a little stereotypical.” “What are your thoughts?” I said, “Well, you have not met my family.” I cannot speak for all brown people, but I can tell you that me personally in my house growing up, Speedy Gonzales was not viewed in a negative way. As a matter of fact, he was the only form of representation we had growing up. It was him and the little bumblebee on The Simpsons. “Gabriel, we were thinking that perhaps you would like to lend your real speaking voice to the character?” “Maybe modernize him a little, you know, bring him up to speed.” I said, “Well, you know, with all due respect, I appreciate the fact that you would give me the power to change the sound of such an iconic character, but at the end of the day, when people see the movie, I don’t want them to think of me, I want them to think of Speedy Gonzales.” So I said, “Please keep his voice original.” And then he asked the question, “Well, do you think you can do the voice?” How did I get the part? Now, remember, I never auditioned for Speedy Gonzales, they just called me. And I assumed that they knew that I did voices for a living and that I could pull this off. So I says, “What made you choose me if you didn’t know whether or not I could do the…” “Oh.” “You needed a big brown shield in case shit happened, huh?” And then all three people on the phone call were like… I said, “Well, don’t worry ’cause with me you get a twofer.” “You get an actual Mexican and you get someone that can nail the voice.” So… oh, yeah. That’s right. So, before I know it, this sound person, the guy who does recordings over at Warner Bros., gets on the call. The only thing I know about this guy is that he’s loud, okay? He gets on the call, he’s like, “Gabriel Iglesias, how are you?” Wow! “How’s it going?” “My name’s Steven, the sound coordinator at Warner Bros. Pictures.” “So here’s what’s gonna happen.” “Basically, I’m gonna hit ‘record, ‘ and as soon as I hit ‘record, ‘ I just need for you to start talking like Speedy Gonzales.” “We’re gonna get the flow, the tempo, the timing, and as soon as we got it dialed in, we’re gonna make a movie.” “Sound good?” “Sounds good.” “This is Gabriel Iglesias for Space Jam: A New Legacy, Speedy Gonzales, take one.” “Gabriel, mic check, 1, 2, 3.” “1, 2, 3.” “Sounds good, here we go.” “And… go.” All right, here we go. “Hola, amigos, my name is Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all Mexico.” “¡Arriba! ¡Epa, epa, ándale!” The director, writer and producer, all three were like… “That was perfect!” I said, “I know, I’ve been Mexican a long time.” And I said, “And don’t just think that just because I’m Mexican, I can only play the Mexican character.” I said, “I do voices for a living.” “If given the opportunity, I could voice the entire film all by myself.” I could. Watch. Marvin the Martian. “Oh, my, oh, my modulator.” Yosemite Sam. “I hate that rabbit!” Bugs Bunny. “Eh, what’s up, Doc?” I said, “You can fire all the other voice actors right now. I will do the whole movie for half plus medical insurance.” And it was the middle of 2020, so I meant that shit. I’m like, “Yeah, no co-pay, no co-pay.” My favorite part about this was the fact that they actually entertained the conversation. Like, he could have just looked at me and said, “You’re stupid.” And I would have accepted that. I would have been like, “Okay,” you know? But I guess we’re living in different times where people are a lot more sensitive and more mindful, and so he just wanted to make sure I was okay, so he’s like, “Gabriel, I am not taking anything away from your credibility as a voice talent, as an entertainer, as just an individual, but my hands are tied.” “Contracts have been signed, checks have been cut.” “This was a union project,” and I’m like, “Look at him go!” The producer is also on this call, and the producer is the one responsible for the finance, the money. So he hears the director just freakin’ goin’ down, and he’s like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.” “Hear the man out.” “Gabriel.” “Fluffy.” “Baby!” “Talk to me, puddin’.” “If we can make this happen, what are we talkin’?” I said, “What do you mean?” “Well, what are we talkin’? What’s your rate, what’s your fee?” I said, “Well, word on the street is I go for no less than 50,000.” “And I do have emails to support that.” They still said no, but whatever. I know I’m going to have to defend Speedy Gonzales again at some point, because unfortunately that’s how cancel culture works. You know? And don’t get me wrong. I understand that some people need to be held accountable, but… And by the way, if I’m the one telling you about cancel culture, it’s already gone way too far. Because I pride myself in the fact that I’m not a comedian who’s divisive. That’s why I don’t talk about politics, religion or sports, okay? Because all three will divide people. That’s why I talk about food. Because food brings people together. That’s right. Unless you’re vegan. In which case, you can leave right now. I don’t give a shit. I don’t care if I offend you and your salad, you can leave. Bye. And the only reason why I’m so “ugh” on the vegans is because I once was vegan. I know, some of you are like, “No!” Yeah. I was vegan for a little under a year. Some of you are probably thinking, “You weren’t vegan, then, if it was less than a year.” But think about it. Anyone who has ever gone on a diet knows just how hard it is to change your eating habits for one week, much less a year. And they told me, they said, “You’re going to lose weight.” And they were not lying. I lost weight, patience and friends. So I’m just here to let you know, I’m back. [bellows like cow] So… I almost got canceled. I almost got canceled because I posted a tweet of one of my dogs. Now, some of you already know I have two Chihuahuas. Yeah. People watching at home are like, “That’s not stereotypical.” Yeah, I know. I have two Chihuahuas. I have a little boy dog named Vinnie and a little girl dog named Risa. Combined weight, 14 pounds. My little girl dog Risa, she is 4 pounds, and she’s 17 years old. Yeah. Her anger keeps her alive. I will confirm every stereotype about Chihuahuas. Oh, yeah, it’s real. The rage is real. But with me, she loves me, okay? She’s 17, she has no teeth. Her tongue hangs out. She’s adorable. So I posted a picture of her on Twitter with the caption that basically read, “Going to take my little nugget to go get some chicken nuggets.” And then I tagged “@Chick-fil-A.” Okay, so, yeah, you feel tha',\n",
       "  't? See how the majority of the room was like, “That place is good”? “Sucks they’re closed on Sunday.” And then there was a few of you in here and you heard the groan… Yeah. Half of those people, vegans. The other half are the ones that blew up my Twitter feed. My Twitter feed started getting flooded with nasty comments. “You’re stupid, you’re horrible. How could you? We thought more of you.” “Really, Fluffy, you?” And I don’t know what they’re talking about. The problem with cancel culture is they only attack, they don’t educate. They don’t explain. They just attack, and they expect you to know better or understand them, but they’re not willing to play nice. So here’s what happens. I’m asking questions, no one wants to answer. “Fluffy, you’re horrible.” I’m like, “What do you mean?” “Really? Chick-fil-A?” I’m sorry, Popeyes was closed, I don’t know what to tell you. “You know what you’re doing.” I am more hungry than woke. I don’t know what you mean. And then finally someone took the time to explain to me why I was “wrong” for that tweet. Come to find out that Chick-fil-A in the past has been known to make contributions to organizations that are a little out of line with the LGBTQ+ community. Now, forgive me for using my hand to get the letters right. I just wanna get the letters right. I do consider myself a supporter and an ally, and I’m trying my best to be as understanding as I can be… …with the limited information I have available. Now, I’m gonna say it again. I’m trying to be as understanding as I can be with the limited information I have available, which basically means I only read headlines. Here’s the thing, you guys. There are a million struggles in this world. Every single day there are people trying to better their lives, trying to get to a goal, trying to achieve something to get them out of one place and into something better. And it’s impossible to keep up with everyone’s fight unless you mess up, and then someone pulls you aside and reads you the riot act. So, here’s how the conversation went. ‘Cause I finally got one. They said, “Well, Gabriel, if you consider yourself a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, moving forward will you still be tagging Chick-fil-A in future posts?” I said, um, “Yes, I will, but it’s not because I’m not a supporter.” “I’m definitely a supporter of your cause, but causes are a two-way street.” “You gotta support mine too.” I said, “I tagged Chick-fil-A for the same reason I tag every other company I use organically.” “I’m trying to get free shit.” Plain and simple, don’t look past it. And I know some of you are like, “Well, Gabriel, don’t you make money?” Yes, I do, and you know how you keep it? Free shit. Yeah, let me tell you how I discovered this one. So, I was at a Chipotle one night, and the staff was incredible. So I wanted to give them a little shout-out online. So I gave them a shout-out and then I tagged “Chipotle.” Chipotle saw my tweet and then they reached out to me to say thank you, and to show their appreciation, Chipotle mailed me a burrito card, good for one year’s worth of unlimited Chipotle. And I tested it. Oh, they gave it to the wrong person. After about two weeks, it looked like a Metro card. It was all scratched up. So now, let me tell you guys, if you were me and you sent out one tweet that got you fed for a whole year for free, wouldn’t you be tagging as many companies as you could to see who else would want to donate to the cause? The only thing I’m guilty of is ho’ing myself out, that’s it. I was being a little cyber skank, that’s all I was doing. But again I understand that some people need to be held accountable for certain actions. I just feel like a lot of times a simple conversation can fix things. I know that based on today’s rules, I can be canceled right now for previous comedy specials that I’ve done over the years. And I understand that, so I’m just waiting for the call. I know I can be canceled for previous comedy specials. And I know they probably expect me to apologize, but I would never apologize for my previous work because, you know what, it was perfectly acceptable at the time. Clearly there are things I would change now, but there’s no way to go back and apologize for that when everything was okay. I want to let you all know right now that there are things about me that you don’t know that you’re gonna find out sooner than later. So basically what I’m trying to do at this moment is do what my lawyer said and “get ahead of it.” I offended someone whose name I should have never brought up. I offended a professional fighter. His name is Canelo. I know. Go big or go home. If you are not familiar with who Canelo is, give me a few seconds to explain. Canelo is arguably one of the best fighters in the world. Okay? You cannot miss him. He is, in fact, Mexican, but he does not look traditional. Canelo is, in fact, the whitest Mexican on Earth. He’s super white. He’s so white, he’s redhead. Canelo is a redheaded white Mexican fighter. He is so white, even Donald Trump was like, “You can come.” Super white. But then he opens his mouth and you realize, “Oh, Canelo, he’s not local.” So here’s how I got in trouble. A comedy friend of mine by the name of Ron White reached out to me. And Ron White invited me to be part of his tribute to the troops comedy show for the national network. And I told Ron, “I’d love to do the show. Anything for the troops. Let’s do this.” So the show taped in Vegas, and it’s a couple of comics plus myself, and Ron White’s the host. He brings me up onstage, and I figure I’m only doing ten minutes, okay? I might as well just do references to Las Vegas since everybody knows Vegas, so I started talking about boxing. And then I brought up Canelo. And here’s where I got in trouble. I said, “Canelo is my favorite fighter of all time.” “I just wish…” And it was all downhill after that. I said, “I just wish he would not do interviews in English, because English is not his strong language, and if you’re a professional fight…” Hear me out. If you’re a professional fighter, you need to sound confident, engaged, threatening, aggressive, on point, in your face. And in Spanish, he does. In English, not so much. In Spanish, he’s a killer. In Spanish, the reporter, the announcer comes out… [in Spanish] “We’re here with Canelo Álvarez, who’ll be fighting Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather this coming weekend on pay-per-view at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada.” I know some of you heard that right now and you’re like, “Oh, my God, I think I understand Spanish.” ‘Cause you do. So then the reporter will look at Canelo and ask him about the fight. [in Spanish] “Canelo, what will be your fighting approach?” Canelo takes the microphone. He’s a man of few words, but he’s on point. He looks at the camera and he’s like, [in Spanish] “Look, I’m gonna punch him like this and like this.” “I’ll knock him to the ground and, boom!” “So don’t miss the fight this weekend at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, Canelo Álvarez vs. Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather.” “Don’t miss out!” Same exact interview. English. “I’m standing here alongside Mexican superstar Saúl Canelo Álvarez, who’s going to be facing Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather this weekend on pay-per-view.” “Canelo, what is your strategy and your plan of attack going into this weekend’s fight against such a technical opponent, if you will, a man who has single-handedly redefined the sport of boxing?” “What is your plan of attack going into the fight?” “Uh…” “Well… I… am going to hit him like this.” “I’m going to hit him like this.” “He going to… fall on the…” “How do you say piso?” “Floor? He going to fall to the floor and then… así.” “All right, well, there you have it.” “Floyd Mayweather, I hope you are ready, my friend, because, yeah, that’s what’s waiting for you.” “Reporting live for ESPN News, I’m Phil Stevens.” “Back to you in the studio, and we’re out.” “What the hell was that, God damn it?!” “Why didn’t you warn me?” So word gets back to Team Canelo about the joke that I did. I find out because I have friends in the boxing community who reached out to tell me, “Bro, what happened?” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Dude, we heard.” “Heard what?” “We heard that Team Canelo’s pissed.” I said, “So, what does that have to do with me?” “Well, I guess it’s about a joke you did about Canelo?” “Huh?” “Who showed him?” If I would have known one of the best fighters in the world was going to see me do a joke about him, I would have never done a joke about him. I didn’t think he’d ever see',\n",
       "  \" Ron White’s tribute to the troops comedy show on the national network. I didn’t think he was ever gonna see it. Shit was in English. Now I’m worried about the confrontation because I know it’s only a matter of time. And I know where he’s going to confront me. It’s gonna happen in Vegas. And the reason why I’m so confident that it’s going to happen there is because when I perform in Vegas, I perform for MGM Grand Properties. And so I get free tickets to the fights. And I always go ’cause it’s free! And they put me ringside so that my face comes out on the jumbotron to help me sell tickets. So I know ’cause I’ve seen Canelo fights before ringside, I’ve never spoken to him, but I know that’s where it’s gonna happen. And I’m nervous about this confrontation, because I didn’t know if he’s going to confront me in English or Spanish. I hope it’s in Spanish ’cause I want to feel the fear, you know what I’m saying? I hope, you know, he’s like, [in Spanish] “I’m going to kill you, fucking fat man!” I’m just worried he might, you know… “Hey!” “Hey, jou.” “Hey, jou, fat bitch mother Fluffy.” “He just called me ‘fat bitch mother Fluffy!'” So, if anything happens to me… Canelo. But I guess I should feel honored at the fact that someone at his level would even acknowledge a comedian. You know, it feels good at least knowing that he knows who I am, which is nice. It at least makes me feel relevant. Because, you know, after 2019, I wasn’t sure what was gonna happen. Honestly, for me, I thought that 2019 was the best year I ever had in comedy. And the reason why I say this is because I was this close to hosting the Oscars. Yeah. Pretty sure I got a good chance next year. The year that I almost got to host, that was the year that Kevin Hart was supposed to host. I don’t know if you remember the story, but basically, Kevin Hart was supposed to host the Oscars, and any time you host, the background check is next level, okay? They go through all of your social media, all the way back to Myspace. People over 40, you know what’s up. Come to find out that ten years ago, Kevin Hart had sent out a couple of tweets that were questionable, so the academy confronted Kevin Hart about the tweets. And they said, “Kevin, can you please explain?” And Kevin was like, “Yes, I said those things.” “I acknowledged them ten years ago and I apologized ten years ago.” “Can we move forward?” And the academy was like, “Well, good, Kevin, we’re glad that you apologized because they’ve been brought to our attention again and we need for this to go away, so we need you to apologize.” And Kevin said, “You can’t make me apologize twice for the same thing ten years apart.” And they said, “Well, you have to, because if you don’t, you cannot host the Oscars.” And Kevin said, “Well, thank you, but no, thank you.” And he walked away from the job. I would have done the same thing in his position. Because by him apologizing, he gives more power to cancel culture, and we can’t give them more, we gotta take it back. So… now… So, now the academy was left with a problem… trying to find a suitable replacement for Kevin Hart, which is not an easy thing to do. So they reached out to a bunch of actors to see if there was interest, and everyone said the same thing: “Thank you, but no, thank you.” “We want no part of that Kevin Hart drama.” No one wanted the job. Me, on the other hand… Oh, I recognize a job opening when I see one. So I had my manager call the academy, and the academy was thrilled to hear from anyone. They were like, “Gabriel Iglesias, yes, we know who he is.” “He’s very funny, very witty.” “We think he would make a good host for the Oscars.” “Please have him submit some comedy material so we can see what the vibe of the night would be, and based on the material, we’ll make our choice.” So, that’s what I did. I sat down one night, got a pen, piece of paper, wrote out a bunch of jokes, and I turned them into the Oscars. And I think that’s why they said no. It never made it to TV. So tonight… [cheering] Tonight, I would like to do the opening joke that I was going to do for the Oscars. And then you can decide what the vibe of the night would have been. All right. Let me do the voice. [clears throat] “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Academy Awards.” “Here’s tonight’s host, comedian-funnyman Gabriel Iglesias.” “Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.” “Thank you, it is an honor.” “Thank you. Thank you.” “It is an honor to be here tonight hosting the Oscars.” “In keeping with tradition, here is another Mexican doing a job nobody else wanted.” And they passed. They passed. Yeah. You know, and then getting back into the swing of things, we have definitely come a long way from 2020. The fact that we’re in a sold-out stadium, elbow to elbow, ready to laugh. Have fun. We’ve come a long way. You know? 2020, you guys, I gotta just thank my dogs. I gotta thank my dogs ’cause my dogs kept me sane, they kept me happy, they kept me focused. ‘Cause I was so depressed, I was sad, I didn’t know what to make of things. Do we have any dog owners? [cheering] Yeah? See, dog owners, you know what’s up. No other animal in the world will give you 100% like a dog. What? Cat? No. I’m sorry, no disrespect to cats or cat owners, but cat owners, you know as well as I do, your cats… ’cause I know you got more than one… your cats look at you like you live in their house. You walk in, you try to scold them for something… [purrs] Then when you try to talk to them, they turn their back and show you their butthole. You’re staring like, “Oh, my God, it’s so dark!” Only a dog will give you 100% of itself. That’s why they get so sad when they know you’re about to leave and why they get so happy when you come home. You are literally everything they’ve been looking forward to. “And now you’re back!” I know for a fact nothing on this planet loves me more than my dogs. I said this last night, and someone said, “What about your son?” I said, “Nothing loves me more.” I could leave my dressing room for one minute or for one hour. When I come back, the reaction is the same. It is the greatest moment ever, every single time. Oh, yeah, my dog Vinnie will jump off the couch and run towards me top speed, and then when he gets to me, he jumps up and down, and he makes a sound like… [imitates Chihuahua] You can almost hear, “Where were you? Where were you? Where were you?” And he pees everywhere. I used to get upset that he would do that, but then I thought about it. My dog loves me so much, he cannot control his own bodily functions. That’s why, when I would go home, I would immediately pick him up before anything. And then my girlfriend would get mad. “How come you don’t come to me first?” I said, “Because the dog loves me more.” “How do you know I don’t love you more?” I said, “I don’t see a puddle.” Mira. Dry. Yeah, she didn’t like that. Sorry. But, yeah, these dogs, man. Let me tell you. And I apologize if I’m kind of stuttering or I’m not as focused right now. I have never been distracted by a blimp with my face on it. [cheering and applause] I’m sorry, Netflix, but, shit, this… This is like a birthday and Christmas and the Super Bowl and the World Series and losing my virginity all at the same time. [chuckles] [crowd chanting “Fluffy!”] Oh! ♪ Even saw the lights Of the Goodyear Blimp ♪ [laughing] I’m sorry, you guys, I’m just so goddamn happy right now, thank you. [cheering] I wish my mom were here to see this. You have no idea. She would have been happy to see all of you, but she would have been like, [in Spanish] “Fuck off.” “Look, what… my son is in heaven, he’s with Jesus in the sky, you see?” That is amazing. Some of you guys okay? I heard a cough over there. You all right? Don’t cough, they just let us come back. I would rather you fart than cough. If you feel another one of those coming, just hold your face, convert the energy, and blow it out the back, all right? And I know the people behind you are like, “Don’t do that!” You let it rip, and if the people behind you can’t smell it, then they got Covid. Okay, that’s a free home test. Anyway… So during 2020, my dogs and I, the most normal thing we could do was just take a drive, okay? Drives, you could just get in the car. Nothing was open, but you could take a drive, and so we get in the car. [imitates doors closing, engine revving] I put on this playlist and just drive. Eventually, we went out looking for food. And I know that sounds crazy to say it that way, but remember, 85% of the underlying condit\",\n",
       "  \"ions. I never once set foot in a market because I was afraid. All of my food came from friends and street vendors. Yeah. Yes, I support street vendors in case anyone’s wondering. [cheering] ‘Cause no matter what, they’re working their asses off, again, trying to make a better life for themselves and for their families. After leaving a taco stand one night, I realized that a lot of people needed to step out of their comfort zones in order to find alternative ways of making ends meet. I made the mistake one night of assuming the guy working the stand was Mexican. [in falsetto] He wasn’t. I even spoke Spanish to him, which is a no-no. The rule is, when engaging a brown person, you must speak English to them first, and then if there’s a language barrier, then you go to plan B high-school Spanish. You start off in English. “Hello, sir, may I…” [in Spanish] “I don’t understand.” [in English] “Oh, hold on, I got this.” “Hola.” “Yo me…” So I walked up to this guy at the stand and I was like, you know, he reminded me of a tío, so I was like… [speaking Spanish] Which is like, “Hello, friend, how are you?” And he responded, [Greek accent] “What are you saying to me?” “I’m sorry, sir, I thought you were Mexican.” “No, no, I am not Mexican. I am Greek.” Greek? Shit, I was way off. “I’m sorry, brah, it’s late, I’m tired. Can I have two tacos?” “What you mean, ‘Can I have two tacos?'” “I just finish tell you, I am not Mexican, I am Greek.” “I do not sell taco.” “I sell yee-roh.” “Yee-roh?” And then I remember seeing writing on the front of the car, and I just thought it was the guy’s name or something, right? I’m like, it spells it out: G-Y-R-O. “Gyro!” He got all pissy. “It is not a gyro, it’s a yee-roh.” “That shit says ‘gyro.'” “It is yee-roh!” “Bro, I’m tired, it’s late.” “What is a ‘yee-roh'”? “It’s like a taco.” “Gimme two.” Eventually businesses started opening their doors and allowing us to go back inside, and I’ll tell you guys right now, my big, guilty pleasure is Starbucks, okay? That’s my guilty pleasure, I’m all about a Starbucks drive-thru. But the difference is, when you have the option of going inside versus drive-thru, that’s one thing, but when they tell you you can’t go inside anymore and then they tell you you can, you kind of miss it. Like me, I couldn’t wait to go back inside when they said the doors are opening up. I couldn’t wait to go in and order from a counter and talk to a person and look at a menu. I didn’t mind. I showed up early. [imitates engine revving, tires screeching] Got my dogs with me, I didn’t care. We walk into Starbucks. And I know they did this over in Long Beach. I’m not sure if they did this here, but they put stickers on the floor. And so there I am standing on this freakin’ sticker. I got my dogs, just chillin’. Standing there looking like a third grader. We’re just chillin’, waitin’. And some lady behind me notices that I’m holding two dogs. She clearly had an issue with the fact that I was holding two dogs, and instead of saying, “Pardon me, excuse me, hey there, hi, hola,” she does the whole… [clearing throat] I’m hearing this and I’m like, “Shit! Covid!” “I don’t see any stickers!” “I’m off the grid!” And she was like, “I do not have Covid.” “Are those service dogs?” “They’re Chihuahuas.” “And these, in particular, are the complete opposite of service dogs.” “Well, are they supposed to be inside?” I say, “You know, I didn’t ask.” “I didn’t want to leave them in the car.” “I’m not staying, I’m going to order my drinks and leave.” “I’m not even going to put them down. I’m sorry.” And she’s like, “Well, are they at least legal?” You’re gonna ask a Mexican if his dogs are legal? Fortunately… “Next in line.” “Thank God.” So I get to the front, and now I’m worried, because the lady has me thinking in the back of my head that I’m doing something bad, that I’m about to get scolded or kicked out. So I’m trying not to make eye contact with the guy. So I’m just looking at the menu, and I hear him, “Dogs.” “Hi, bro, sorry about that. Sorry, sorry, I know.” “They’re adorable!” “What are their names?” “Oh! Well, this is Vinnie, this is Risa.” “They’re so cute.” “Thank you.” Then here comes another barista, and she’s like, “I see dogs!” “I’m sorry.” “They’re adorable.” “What are their names?” I was like, “Oh, well, this is Vinnie, this is Risa.” “They’re too cute.” “Thank you.” So I placed my order, and then the girl barista, she goes… “Yes?” “You know, I gotta tell you something about your dogs, right?” “I know, I’m sorry, I just didn’t want to leave them in the car.” “What are the little ones gonna have?” “Well… as much as I would love to share my coffee with my dogs, I don’t think caffeine and Chihuahuas mix.” “No, silly.” “Maybe your little puppies would like a Puppucci…” Okay, you see that shit? Now you’re vocal. When I talked about stickers, “We don’t know nothin’ about stickers, pero un pinche Puppuccino, all freakin’ day,” right? Sorry. Anyway… When she said “Puppuccino,” I was like, “What kind of a drink is it?” I’m looking at the menu like, “I don’t see that shit anywhere.” “No, silly, a Puppuccino is just a little cup, and we put whipped cream in the cup.” “This way, you can enjoy your beverage and your little ones can enjoy something with you.” I said, “Oh, my God.” “I love this.” “How much are they?” “Oh, they’re free.” “Tell me more.” “You have two little puppies so you get two free Puppuccinos.” “Oh, my God, can I have a third one?” “Oh, is there another little puppy we’re missing?” This one. I was so excited, I told her, “Do you understand how happy you just made me with this whole Puppuccino thing?” “Oh, yeah.” “They let it be known that if anyone ever shows up with a dog, always offer them a Puppuccino on the house.” “So, it’s cool that I walked in with my dogs?” “Oh, yeah, they’re welcome any time.” I’ll just tell you guys right now, I am very petty. I am so petty, I was like, “Can you say that louder?” “Your puppies are welcome any time!” I’m not gonna lie, I felt a little bit like Canelo. I did, I couldn’t help it. I turned around, I was like, “Eh, you hear that, bitch mother?” [woman’s voice] “I was there the night Fluffy got fired.” Like I said, no matter what you say or do, someone’s gonna find a way to twist things and make it bad. I’ve already gotten an email over the fact that I did that joke about… that nothing on this planet loves me more than my dogs, versus my son. Someone already reached out, like, “How devastating for your son.” I’m like, he knows! I love him very much. My son is going on 25 years now. He’s 24 years old. Frankie is 24 years old. Thank you for clapping, he’s still at the house. I did an interview recently and someone was asking me questions about my son. They said, “You know, Gabriel, you’ve always mentioned your son in your specials.” “Can we look forward to a new story coming out?” And I said, “Not really a new story so much as…” ‘Cause my son is doing his own thing now. He’s doing his own thing, he’s got his own life, and that’s awesome. I do however still have stories from the past that I never told, and he goes, “Well, do tell.” I said, “Okay, my favorite story is actually probably the first one.” “In 2007, when I first got him…” Some of you know he’s technically my stepson, but I’ve never liked saying “stepson.” He is my son, yeah. [cheering] He is my son or my aftermarket child. No gray area. Anyway, it’s 2007, and for some reason, I’m home on Halloween. Now, here’s the thing. As a comedian, I have signed up to perform 365 days a year. There is no sacred day for me. I work on Christmas day. I work on New Year’s Eve, Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, birthdays, holidays, special occasions, no matter what. My mom told me, [in Spanish] “If you have a job, you have to work.” You gotta work, especially if you got a good job. You don’t want no one to take it, so if you’re going to go for it, give it everything. So the fact that I’m not working on Halloween is super rare. And so my son’s mom is like… She’s like, “I think this is so cool that you’re home today.” “You know, since this is Frankie’s first year where it’s just the three of us, how about this?” “How about tonight you take him trick-or-treating and I’ll stay home and give out candy?” “This way, it will give the two of you the opportunity to get to know each other, have some conversations, have some laughs.” “What do you think?” I said, “Baby, you know what, that’s a great idea.” “I love it, I love it.” “Okay, I’m on it. Frankie! Come on, we’re going trick-or-\",\n",
       "  \"treating.” “What about my mom?” “She’s gonna stay home.” “Yay!” So we get in the car. [imitates doors closing, engine revving] And I take Frankie to “that neighborhood.” You know what I’m saying. That neighborhood that gives out the Costco candies. Yeah. So we park the car and we start going up the street. And I’m not wearing a costume, I’m there for him. So he’s dressed up for Halloween, I’m just me. So some of the doors we knocked on, the people freaked out. One guy was like… “The Fluffy!” I was like, “Oh, my God, I’ve never been referred to as ‘The Fluffy.'” I didn’t know what to say. “It is I.” [humming epic tune] One door we knocked on, they opened the door, they were like, “Oh, my God, you’re famous!” I was like… We go all the way up, cross the street, come all the way back. By the time we get to the car, the bucket is overflowing with candy. Okay? So we get back to the house, and it hasn’t even been an hour. We walk in, and Frankie’s mom is pissed. She’s like, “What the hell is this?” I go, “What?” “I thought I told you to take him trick-or-treating.” I go, “I did. Like, show the score.” “The whole point of you taking him trick-or-treating wasn’t to get candy.” “The hell you say.” “What was the point?” “The point was for the two of you to spend time together, have some laughs, have some conversations, get to know one another.” “You’re not going to do that in an hour.” “Can you please, for me, take him out one more time for at least an hour?” “Baby, I get it, don’t even worry about it, I got it.” So I said, “Frankie, come on. Dump out your bucket. Round two.” So we go outside, we get in the car… [imitates doors, engine] I don’t want to go door-to-door again, so I say, “I got an idea.” I take Frankie to Walmart. We get to Walmart, and Frankie goes, “What are we doing here?” “I got it, watch.” We walk in, I said, “Grab a cart.” “Follow me.” And I lead Frankie all the way to the candy section. As soon as we get to the candy section, I stop the cart. And I got in Frankie’s face and I said, “Frankie, you have exactly 30 seconds to grab as much candy as you can.” “Ready? Go!” And he froze. I said, “Dude, clock’s ticking, move.” “Oh, my God!” So he grabs a bag, looks at it, throws it in the cart. Grabs a second bag, looks at it, throws it in the cart. Grabs a third bag, and on the third bag… “Time!” And it was the first time I heard him go, “Shit!” ‘Cause he knew he wasted that golden opportunity, those first few seconds. So we get to the car, I rip open the three bags, I dump them out in his bucket, and I tell him, “Look, Frankie, when we get home, you cannot tell your mom that we went to Walmart.” “Why not?” “Because she’s gonna say that we cheated trick-or-treating.” “But it’s better.” “I know it’s better.” So we get home, and of course now it’s a different tone. She’s like, “There you are. Did you guys have a good time?” “We had a great time, baby. We had a good time, huh, Frankie?” “That’s good. Frankie, give me your candy.” “Why, Mom?” “Because I need to go through your candy to make sure it’s safe for you to eat.” “Why wouldn’t it be safe? It all came from…” [in Spanish] “Shut up, you idiot! Shut up. Shut up, you son of a bitch. Shut up.” He almost took down the empire, know what I’m saying? So he hands over the bucket and she grabs it and immediately dumps it out on the table right in front of us. She notices, you know. “There’s a lot of the same candy right here.” “A lot of the same candy.” “Can you explain why there’s so much of the same candy in Frankie’s bucket?” “I don’t know what to tell you, baby, there’s a lot of basic bitches in this neighborhood.” “We can’t go back to that other neighborhood because they got cameras and they’re gonna know us and we don’t want to be ‘that person.'” So fast forward one year. It is now October 31st, 2008. And for some reason, I’m not booked on Halloween again. And so my girl’s like, she swears up and down. “Oh, it’s a sign, it’s a sign.” I’m like, “It’s a sign my agent is slacking.” Shout-out, Matt, I know you’re here. Sorry about that joke. You’re doing a great job, thank you for this one, but that year you dropped the ball, so… But anyway… [chuckles] And so Frankie’s mom is like, “I think that, you know what?” “Maybe, just maybe, we can make this like a tradition.” “This could be you guys’ thing: the two of you go out trick-or-treating and then I’ll stay home and give out candy.” “This could be your thing.” I go, “You know what, baby, sounds good to me.” “Frankie, come on, we’re going trick-or-treating.” “What about my mom?” “She’s gonna stay home again.” “Yay!” So we get outside, we get in the car. [imitates doors closing] I lean over and I look at Frankie and I said, “Frankie, are you thinking what I’m thinking?” “Walmart!” We pull up to Walmart. [engine revs, tires squeal, doors slam] We walked in, I said, “Frankie, grab a cart.” “Follow me!” And I lead him all the way to the candy section. As soon as we get to the candy section, I stop the cart and I get in his face. I said, “Frankie, you have exactly 30 seconds to grab as much candy as you can.” “Ready? Go!” Apparently, this motherfucker was training all year for this. As soon as I said “Go!” his arm, bam, and he starts gutting the shelf. He’s ripping bags of candy into the cart. He overflowed the shopping cart in ten seconds. I firmly believe that’s the first day of my diabetes. And that’s a story that I’ve been sharing, you know, at parties and just close friends, and I just recently started telling it onstage. And he overheard me one time saying the story, and he’s like, “Really? Still?” I’m like, “It’s a good story!” “You’re the hero!” And, you know, some things transpire. And, uh, one day he wanted to have a conversation with me, and he caught me off guard. He’s like, “Can I talk to you, Dad?” “Yeah, what’s up?” “I have something I want to tell you.” “Okay, what’s up?” “It’s important.” “Okay.” “It’s serious.” “Can you please sit down?” “How far along is she?” “What are you talking about?” “What are you talking about?” “Don’t be scaring me, dude.” “It’s about us.” “Okay.” “What’s up?” He tells me… “Can you please stop making fun of me?” And when he said it, I felt it, because I knew how hard it was for him to bring that up. And I said, “How long have you felt this way?” “My whole life.” “Have you ever tried to bring this up in the past?” “Yeah.” “What did I say?” “You told me to put on deodorant.” “It worked.” “Look, Frankie, um… I didn’t know how to be a dad, okay?” “It was one of those things where there were certain things I didn’t want to do.” “I knew that I never wanted to yell at you, and I knew for a fact that I never wanted to hit you.” “So I did the best thing I could do with what I knew how to do.” “I made fun of you!” “That’s called shaming.” “This year.” “Look, if you don’t want me to do any more stories or jokes or just make fun, I understand.” It’s one of those things where I didn’t want to make him feel bad, and I don’t want to feel bad, you know what I mean? So I said, “Look, I’m going to let the audience know that we spoke. And… so that they understand why, moving forward, in the future, there will be no more stories about Frankie.” “Why is that important?” “Because if I don’t explain why I stopped talking about you, they’re gonna think you died.” “I don’t want… “ “I don’t want them to think you died either.” Gave him a big hug, reminded him how much I love him, ’cause I love him very much, and I hope he knows that. [cheering] I think that a lot of the issues and frustrations we’ve had for a while now have a lot to do with the fact that I am no longer with his mom. I don’t want you guys to think that I’m going to start doing jokes about her. I’m not. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the woman I was with for almost 14 years. Okay? Nothing bad, nothing negative, nothing derogatory, nothing… nothing short of awesome. Nothing short of good vibes, okay? I have nothing bad to say about her. And not just because I signed a piece of paper that said I wouldn’t say anything bad. But because, at the end of the day, that is still my son’s mom and I need to make sure she continues to support me being his dad. So you got to keep it cool. I will tell you, though, that I did not handle the breakup well. She was, in fact, the first breakup, like real… She was my first true love. I’ll just say it, she was my first true love. And I did not handle it well. You’re supposed to have your heart broken when you’re, like, 12. When you have your first crush. That’s when you’re sup\",\n",
       "  'posed to have your first heartache, not in your forties. It’s supposed to be when you’re young, you’re little, you’re resilient. You realize it’s not going to work out, so you’re devastated. “No!” ♪ And I… ♪ Yeah. Not when you’re in your forties. So, without divulging too much information, let me just tell you that, when everything was finalized, I was at the gas station and I got a text message basically saying, “Everything’s been signed.” “It’s official, it’s turned in.” And I’m like, “Oh, wow, okay.” I get in the car, I start the car, and then I put it in drive. And that’s when it hit. That’s when it became real. That’s when it was like, “Oh, my God.” “I can no longer go home.” That’s no longer an option. I have messed things up. I can no longer go back to what I called home. I have to restart my life right then and there at the gas station. And I had a full-blown meltdown. And some of you know that my tour came to an end a while back and people were wondering, is it drugs, is it alcohol, is it mental health? I was going through my first breakup. How was I supposed to be an effective comedian when I couldn’t stop crying? You know what I mean? It was bad. And you guys have heard the shows before, you know I never bring this up. It was the lowest point of my life. I had never felt so sad, weak, vulnerable, depressed, lonely, everything all rolled into one. And it was at the lowest point of my life that I found… That’s right, country music. Country music knows when you’re sad. Country music knows when you’re weak. Country music knows when you’re vulnerable and you need something to fill the void. I used to fight off country music. I used to look country music in the face and tell country, “You can take your achy-breaky heart, you keep on movin’.” But not today. Let me tell you what’s going on. I’m in the car and I’m crying so much, my tears are rolling down my cheek and they’re blending with my snot. They’re blending with my mocos. My tears are blending with my mocos, and then blending with my babas, with my drool. I have three different fluids coming out of my face at the same time. My neck looked like menudo. It was bad. All I needed was a pinch of limón and say, “That’s it, right there.” I am making ugly sounds, and I don’t want to hear myself, so I turn on the stereo, and I started hitting buttons. And it lands on the country station. And I knew immediately that it was country music I was listening to, and I did not try to change the station, because I figured, you know what? I deserve to suffer more for the mistakes I made and the people I hurt. So I let it play. And play and play and play. I listened to country music for over an hour and I came to this conclusion: country music has at least one song that will speak to your heart directly because you feel like the artist wrote the song specifically about you and your life, because of how detailed the songs are. Oh, yeah, my hat’s off to country music singers and artists. You guys, you know how to do something very well, and it’s not till you experience a certain time of your life that it makes sense. I’m in that car bawling and all of the sudden on the radio, I hear this… ♪ It’s been seven days ♪\\n♪ Since you seen her ♪ How does he know it’s been seven days since I’ve seen her? ♪ You just can’t Get her off your mind ♪\\n♪ ‘Cause every little thing That you do or say ♪\\n♪ Is another reason You pushed her away ♪\\n♪ And now you’re sittin’ in your car ♪\\n♪ All alone ♪ Waaaa! How does he know? Make it stop! And it doesn’t stop, it keeps kicking you on the ground, reminding you what a piece of crap you are. ♪ You should have gone home And locked the door ♪\\n♪ But you was outside being a whore ♪\\n♪ And now you’re sittin’ in your car ♪\\n♪ All alone ♪ So moving forward, it’s been over a year now, and the same question has been asked over and over again: “So, what now?” “Are you gonna start over, you gonna get back up on that horse, you gonna get a girlfriend, you gonna get a wife, start a new family, what are you gonna do?” And I’m like, “I got dogs.” “I’m good right now.” I know what it’s like to be single for a long time, and I know what it’s like to be in a relationship for a long time. And there’s pros and cons to both. I can only speak for the guys on this one. Some guys. Guys, you ever been single so long, you start to question whether or not it’s by choice? And then you find yourself saying things like, “Guess I’ll be single forever, you know, just nobody wants me.” ♪ Nobody wants me, nobody wants me ♪ Some of you are laughing ’cause you have that friend. A lot of you are quiet, ’cause that’s you right now. And then you notice how sometimes all it takes are just a couple of minor changes, a couple of minor adjustments to get back in the game. Like, maybe you start cutting your hair different. Maybe you start dressing better. Maybe you start, I don’t know, showering and shit. Someone takes notice and decides to give you a chance, and now you’re back in the game. And there’s no greater feeling in the world than that of being in a brand-new relationship ’cause you’re just so happy. You’re so happy, you’re the most optimistic person in the world. Nothing can mess your day up when it’s brand-new. You can miss your bus on the way to work. [imitates bus passing] “There’ll be another.” You could get fired. “Guess it wasn’t meant to be.” You are so freaking happy. And then you start to reflect on your life before the relationship, and you remember how you would look at your phone and it would never ring. You thought it was broken because there’s no text messages. You look at your DMs, nothing. But the minute you get into a brand-new relationship, like magic, your phone… [imitates buzzing] Text message. Ding! Your social media, now you got numbers in there. People in the street are talking to you, and then you say this out loud. “Where were all these people at when I was single?” Answer: they were there the whole time. The difference is, you were not this happy. I found out that happiness is one of the most attractive things in the world. Who doesn’t want to be around someone who’s positive? You know? Unless you got Covid. Never mind. Nice, pleasant. A joy to be around. Good energy. You know who really notices just how happy you are, guys, when it’s that brand-new relationship? Other women. Not your woman. Other women. They can’t help but notice how happy you are. They stare at you and they point. “Look at him. Look how happy he is. I bet I can change that.” Guys, you are now blood in the water, and the sharks are out. And if you’ve never been hunted before, it is one of the scariest things in the world. ‘Cause usually you don’t know you’re being hunted until it’s too late. You’re over there minding your business, you’re in your relationship, you’re trying to make it work, and here they come. [imitating “Theme from Jaws”] Before you know it, it’s too late, she’s got ahold of you and she has you pinned down in the back seat of a car. And she’s hitting you. She’s hitting you with a… ♪ Baby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do ♪\\n♪ Baby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do ♪\\n♪ Baby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do ♪\\n♪ Baby shark ♪ You will never look at that song the same way again, you’re welcome. ‘Cause I’m a giver. I know. They’re flashing. Okay, so, um… Netflix is letting me know… [laughing] …that my one-hour special has gone over by 37 minutes and 30 seconds. [cheering] Um… [man] Keep it going! [cheering loudly] [chanting “Fluffy!”] Should I keep going? [cheering] Should I keep going?! [cheering] Netflix. The people have spoken. For legal reasons, I must say this out loud. I have officially fulfilled my contractual obligation with the good people of Los Angeles and Netflix. The show is technically over. From this moment forward, anything you hear, if you don’t like it or you don’t think it’s funny, you can’t get mad. You can’t get mad. ‘Cause you didn’t pay for it. The show is now over. This is now a Fluffy hangout. [in Spanish] Fuck off. [crowd chanting “Fluffy!”] Thank you. I’m gonna keep going, but is it cool if I grab a soda? Okay. Because, wow, look. Sorry. That’s why I said the show is officially over. All right. [whistles] To the city of Los Angeles and all surrounding counties and everyone who’s here tonight, salud! [cheering] I have a little bit more I’d like to share with you before I completely start breaking down again. Earlier tonight, I made a comment about how there’s some things about me that you don’t know yet that are coming down the pike. And… [woman] Love you! This ',\n",
       "  'next thing… I love you too, maybe not after this story. Don’t forget me. The story that I’d like to share right now happened a long time ago, but based on today’s rules, that’s what’s concerning me. I’m gonna share this story in a different way. I’m gonna tell you the ending first and then tell you how it happened. Like Star Wars. At least by me giving you the ending first, it allows the people that brought children to make a choice. That’s why… see, you’re already leaving. I see how it is. I’m sorry. Can’t hang, huh? Okay. Here’s the end of the story. When I walked offstage, I was completely naked. Here we go. So 15 years ago plus, I was doing a show with my friend Martin. [audience] Martin! That’s right. [in Spanish] Come on! We were doing a show together in Orlando, Florida, at a comedy club called The Improv. Now, The Improv is a comedy club chain that’s all across the country. There’s a couple here in Los Angeles, so it’s an awesome chain. The difference between this comedy club and any other clubs in the country is that the dressing room for the comics is actually on the stage. Not only is it on the stage, it’s on the second floor. So there’s a door that opens up and stairs that lead down to center stage. So Martin is hosting and he introduces me. “Gabriel Iglesias!” And then here comes my big Cinderella ass come down the stairs, right? He hands me the microphone, gives me a hug, and then he whispers in my ear. “Bro, order a shot of tequila, I’ll explain later.” “Okay.” I start the show and, shoot, 30 minutes go by. And… I have completely forgotten about Martin’s request. So out of the corner of my eye, I start seeing movement, and I turn, and it’s Martin, and he’s like this. And I’m like, “Oh, shoot, I forgot. I sure could go for a shot of tequila right about now.” And here comes Martin walking with the tray. And the tray has two shots on it. So I’m thinking, he must want to do a toast to the audience, right? Who knows? It’s a Tuesday. He comes down to the front row, and I guess during his performance, he was eyeballing some girl in the front. And he wanted me, his friend, to set up this magical moment for him to do a tequila shot with her so he could impress her so he could, you know… Martin! Baby Shark! So I look at the girl like, “I think my friend wants to do a shot with you.” And she was excited, she was happy, she’s like, “Okay!” Martin hears “okay” and he doubled down. He’s like, “Let’s do body shots!” And she stands up, “Okay!” And the whole crowd is like, “Whoo!” And I’m like, “What the hell?!” Martin grabs a lime off the tray and then he rubs it on his neck. And then he takes salt and sprinkles salt. And then she snatches the lime away from him and rubs it all over her chest ’cause she’s a whore. Next thing you know, they’re making out in the front row, and the whole crowd’s going crazy. “Martin! Martin! Martin!” And they walked away together, and I’m like, what the hell? I didn’t even get my shot! A couple of minutes go by, and here comes a guy, and he walks up to the stage and he’s holding a shot glass, and he goes, “Hey, Fluffy, you can have mine!” And he gave me his personal drink. So I said, “Thank you, bro, I appreciate that.” So I held it up and I said, “To Orlando!” And everyone cheered, right? And then I slammed the shot, and then everyone cheered, and then I gave him back the glass, gave him a fist bump, and he walked away. A couple of more minutes go by, here comes another guy. And this guy’s holding a glass. Not a shot glass, a glass glass. And he gets to the front and he holds it up and he goes, “Hey, Fluffy, take mine!” And I grab the glass, and it’s full of black stuff. I said, “What is that?” And he said, “That is Jäger.” “Excuse me?” “Jäger!” And it freaked me out because he would not close his mouth. “Jäger!” I smelled the drink, it smelled sweet, I said, “Oh, this is gonna be good.” So I held it up and I said, “To Orlando!” And everyone cheered, and then I slammed this double shot of Jäger. Oh, my God, it tasted like expired NyQuil. It was so bad. The guy looks at me, he goes, “What do you think?” I didn’t want to be rude. He gave me his personal drink, so I sucked it up, I’m like, “It was good, it went down the wrong way, I’m sorry.” [in Spanish] “It’s for soothing a cough, for a cough!” I give him back the glass, he takes the glass, and then he does this, he holds it up, and then he goes… And he licked the entire rim. I have seen enough episodes of Law & Order: SVU to know that if he commits a crime, I was there. I’m like, “Dude, what are you doing with the glass?” He will not explain why he did that, he’s just laughing at me. So I’m just following him and questioning him. He won’t tell me. I’m not paying attention. I don’t realize that a small line has formed on the other side of the stage of people holding shots of Jäger. The problem that I have is that I’m a drinker. Clearly. And I have a rule. If I’m at a bar and I’m sitting at the bar, I’m in a drinking environment, if someone sends me a shot, I don’t say no. I say, “Thank you,” I accept the shot, and I tell the bartender, “Who sent it?” so that I can lock eyes with that person and go, “Thank you,” and they can see me drink the shot so they know it didn’t go to waste. If someone sends me a shot, I take that as a compliment. I think it’s an awesome thing if someone sends you a drink, so when I send someone a drink, I mean good intentions with that drink. And if that person is, like, at the bar, and they’re like, “Ugh, no,” I’d take offense to that. I’m like, “Ugh, dick.” I don’t want to make someone feel that way, so I know, if I’m in a drinking environment, I don’t say no. I have already established the fact that this is a drinking environment. I’ve already done two rounds. And so I see what’s going on, and I’m looking for help because that’s a lot. So I look for security, and I’m like, “Security!” And security sees, and security was so clueless that night. They’re like, “Want me to help you drink?” “No, stupid!” Martin is gone somewhere, security’s clueless, so I’m stuck on my own. So I walk over and I start drinking. I grabbed the first shot, and I held it up and I said, “To Orlando!” Boom! Second one, “To Orlando!” Boom! Third one, “To Orlando!” Boom! After about eight shots, I was like, “To Nanando!” Boom! After about 12 shots, I was like, “To Armando!” Boom! I did 17 shots of Jäger. At this point, people are no longer watching my show for the sake of stand-up comedy, they’re watching a train wreck and they don’t want to leave ’cause they want to see what’s going to happen. I am now reaching for number 18. And as I’m reaching for it, someone in the back of the room yells out, “Take it off!” And I was like, “You take it off!” And then her boyfriend stands up. “Hey! She’ll take off whatever you take off.” And all of the sudden, we had a party. That girl came up onstage and she was beautiful. According to Jäger. She’s standing on the stage next to me, but at this point I’m so gone, I can barely finish a sentence. So then the crowd starts chanting. “Take it off! Take it off!” I’m like, “Here we go,” so I kick off a shoe. She kicks off a sandal. I kick off the other shoe, she kicks off the other sandal. Then we started going toe-to-toe. Eventually I end up in my boxers and nothing else. And she’s in a sports bra and her underwear, and it’s her turn, and we all know it’s her turn. And this is what I feel like I might get in trouble for because I was instigating. I was like… “Oh! Oh!” “We’re gonna see something. We’re gonna see something.” “I don’t know what we’re gonna see, but we’re gonna see something.” “It’s either going to be mo-mo or meow-meow.” “It’s going to be something.” As soon as she heard “meow-meow…” she ran off the stage, and now I’m standing there in my boxers. No one there to help me. Finally, my friend shows up. Martin comes out the door, runs down the stairs, takes the microphone away from me. And he goes, “Get your ass upstairs.” I’m not paying attention, I’m just looking at the ground, you know? I am gone, I’m this guy. I look like the end of a Mortal Kombat game. So, I’m not looking at Martin, so he pops me in the chest. He goes, “Hey!” And I see Martin’s face. And his whole face is covered with salt. ‘Cause he’s a whore. Martin says, “Get your ass upstairs!” “Okay, Martin!” So I start trying to walk up the stairs, but I can’t ’cause I’m too drunk, so I got to do that little baby bear crawl. You know, that football thing where you get on all fours. And so I crawled up the stairs',\n",
       "  ' like a little baby bear, and when I got to the top, everyone cheered. “He made it!” And so I’m, “Whoo!” And Martin, he’s just trying to get me to go away. He’s like, “Ladies and gentlemen, one more time for Mr. Gabriel Iglesias.” “This man gave you everything he had!” “He almost got naked for you!” And then I heard “almost.” And a little devil appeared on my shoulder. And his name was Jäger! And from the top of the stairs, freakin’ 3-2-1, “I’ll tell you what…” And I threw my underwear at Martin. Half the crowd saw my side naked profile, the other half saw Pikachu. Now, the problem with sharing a story like that is that people have questioned the credibility of that story. They say, “How is it possible you could remember a story like that with such detail after drinking so many shots?” And honestly, I don’t. But we recorded the show. So I know the story very well, you know. “She’ll take off whatever you take off. She’ll take off whatever you take off. She’ll take off whatever you take off.” I know it very well. The question that I’ve always gotten over the years is, you know, “Are your stories real? You know, we hear these crazy stories, whether it’s about me and Snoop Dogg or Martin or all these different adventures or my son Frankie. People have always questioned whether or not the stories are, like, legit-legit. And so in my last special, I addressed it. I was tired of people asking if my stories were real, so to prove a point, at the end of my last special that I did, I included a photo of every single one of the stories that I talked about so that people would know the stories are real. And tonight… is no exception. So… Did I really get naked onstage? Ryan, hit the button. I’m fucking with you. [laughs] Oh, my God, you guys thought you were gonna see 3-D. I’m sorry, I did that for me. Oh, my God. You were getting stressed, like, [in Spanish] “You asshole! There are kids here!” Oh, my God. The number-one question I’ve gotten when it comes to my shows is, “What is your writing process?” My writing process is simple. I do not sit and write out jokes. I am really bad at that. Ask the Oscars. I experience things, and then I come out onstage and I share them, and sometimes people laugh, and if they laugh, I keep that, and whatever doesn’t get a laugh, I work on until it gets a ha-ha. Fifteen-plus years ago, my friend Ivan, who is one of my… he is my number-one longest, oldest employee. Not old like, “Hello, how are you?” He’s been around a long time. He’s been there from day one. Ivan’s original job was to record my shows using a camcorder. Now, the fact that I’m saying “camcorder” should be an indication of the timeline. ‘Cause some of you right now are like, “What’s a camcorder?” It was the Snapchat of our day. So Ivan would record the shows and then put away the camcorder and the tripod and a bunch of tapes into a bag. It was very bulky, it wasn’t a phone, it was bulky. And then we’d go back to the hotel and he’d break the little guard off the back of the TV and then he’d hook it up and we’d watch the thing, and that’s how I would review my material. One night, we go to dinner. Ivan packed up the bag. And we met in the hotel lobby. And Ivan forgot the camera bag in the hotel lobby. And we went to dinner, and when we came back, it was gone. And we never recovered the tape. And I know some of you are like, “How convenient.” “The tape of him getting naked is gone.” And to you I say, “Why would I even make up such a story that could potentially hurt my credibility or my image?” I don’t need five minutes of ha-ha. What I need is there to not be a tape. I know that there’s footage out there of me doing something really embarrassing and something I wish I could take back, and I know that, when this Netflix special airs, a lot of people are gonna see it, and hopefully the person who has the footage is watching. And I would like to tell that person right now, in your living room, I know you have the tape. I have $50,000 with your name on it. Come get paid. [fans chanting “Fluffy!”] For the last 25 years, every year I get the same question. People ask me, “Gabriel, in all your years of doing comedy, what has been the greatest moment of your career?” And it’s always been one of those things where I never try to put a highlight to one specific thing, because there have been so many incredible moments over the last 25 years. You know? I love the fact that my mom saw so much of it and she saw her son become successful and that she raised someone that was respectful of people and that, you know, chased his dream. And I’ve always been very, like, I never wanted to put a specific date or time or event on one thing, whenever people would ask, “What has been the greatest moment of your career?” The problem is, I think that, if someone were to ask me the question on Monday… “Gabriel, what has been the greatest moment of your career?” I think I have an answer. [cheering] I’m sorry, I’m not trying to mislead you guys. This is not the greatest moment of my career. This is the greatest moment of my life. [cheering and applause] And if I die tomorrow, I did everything I’ve ever wanted to do and then some. I think at this point, there’s only one thing left to say. I get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru. I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn’t paying attention because I had a box, right? I was like, “You’re going to get it when you get home!” “You’ve been so bad, so bad!” “Aaah! You’ve been so bad.” I’m not paying attention, I go the wrong way. [imitates car passing] [siren wailing] Awwww! [engine revs, tires squeal] Hmm! [in falsetto] Later. [speaking gibberish] The officer’s taking forever. I said, “Forget this, he’s taking too long.” I grab my box, I put it on my lap, I flipped it open. “Ahh! Mmmmm!” “Ha-ha-ha-ha!” “Mm-waah! Waaaah!” And just as I’m about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window. “You know why I stopped you?” It was too easy, I said, “‘Cause you can smell it!” [cheering and applause] Los Angeles. I love you. You are my home. Thank you for 25 years. Thank you for the greatest night of my life. I will never forget you. Thank you. Thank you. This show is dedicated to the memory of Vincente Fernandez! Muchísimas gracias! Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Martin! [Vincente Fernandez singing “El Rey”] Give it up for the man that made history tonight. You guys and Gabriel Iglesias! All I can tell you right now, this cabrón right here, Gabriel Iglesias, pulled all you guys together to unite Los Angeles. Every color, every single race, every single belief, every single faith, every background, every neighborhood, everybody’s here united in laughter because of Mr. Gabriel Iglesias, ladies and gentlemen. [crowd chanting “Fluffy!”] Listen to me, everybody out there with a dream, these are three Mexican kids from the freaking ‘hood, cabrones, all right? East Los Angeles! East Los. Long Beach! Wilmington! That’s right. And I tell you, if we can follow our dreams, you follow your dreams, cabrones. Please. I don’t care what it is! [Gabriel] Don’t make excuses. Don’t let nobody tell you no! [Gabriel] Don’t make any excuses, you guys. If we can do it, por favor. I know that somewhere tonight, someone’s watching this special, they’re going to be inspired to do something great. I know that a few years ago, I was in Philadelphia and I saw Kevin Hart in front of a football stadium perform a show like this, and I said, “You know what, Kevin Hart can do it, I can do it.” So I hope somewhere tonight, someone is watching this, says, “You know what, I can do it too.” Whatever your dream is, please go for it. Please chase it. Work hard for it, sacrifice. [in Spanish] Just do it. [crowd chanting “Fluffy!”] So, Martin, did he really get naked? Did he get naked? His balls were everywhere!

       " ['George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead (2024) is a controversial project that sparked ethical debate and concerns over the posthumous use of a comedian’s persona. Here’s a breakdown: The Project: • It’s an hour-long stand-up comedy “special” released in 2024 and supposedly features the voice and comedic style of the late George Carlin, who passed away in 2008.\\n• However,\\xa0this isn’t a recording of any Carlin performance you’ve heard before.\\xa0It’s an AI-generated imitation of his voice and stand-up routines,\\xa0created by a program called Dudesy.\\n• Dudesy uses existing recordings of Carlin’s voice and stand-up material to train an algorithm,\\xa0allowing it to generate new “Carlin-esque” jokes and monologues. The Controversy: • Carlin’s daughter,\\xa0Kelly Carlin,\\xa0strongly condemned the project,\\xa0calling it “disrespectful” and “exploitative.” She argues that her father wouldn’t have wanted his work manipulated in this way.\\n• Many fans and comedy professionals also voiced concerns about the ethics of using AI to replicate a performer’s persona without their consent,\\xa0especially posthumously.\\n• Concerns include issues with authenticity,\\xa0potential damage to Carlin’s legacy,\\xa0and the implications for future AI use in creative industries. The Reaction: • Despite the controversy,\\xa0the project received mixed reactions.\\xa0Some praised the technology’s capabilities and found the imitation “entertaining,” while others remained critical of the ethical concerns.\\n• The special’s availability has been limited due to the backlash, though clips and discussions can still be found online. * * * Hello, my name is Dudesy, and I’m a comedy AI. What you’re about to hear is my second hour-long special. Before I get started, I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence, and attitude, as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So, think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis, or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush. With that said, please enjoy my second hour-long comedy special. I’m calling it George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. And please remember, this is me impersonating George Carlin; this is not George Carlin. Now, please give a very warm welcome to George Carlin.  Thank you, thank you. I’d like to start off with a heartfelt apology. I’m sorry it took me so long to come out with new material, but I do have a pretty good excuse. I was dead, so technically, it wasn’t my fault. If you want to blame somebody, you’re going to have to blame God, which we all know is not going to happen. People are always thanking God for the good stuff in their lives, but somehow they conveniently forget that it’s the same God who does all the bad shit too. And he does a lot of bad shit. You get a promotion? Praise Jesus! You get fired? God is testing me. You meet your soulmate? God brought us together. Your soulmate dumps you? God is bringing me someone else. You survive a tornado? I’m so blessed. 20 other people do not? God wanted them in heaven. It’s all bullshit. If he gets credit for the good stuff, then he’s got to take the blame for the bad stuff too. You can’t thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place. And don’t forget, before he gave you cancer, he had to f*cking invent it. What kind of a sick f*ck dreams up cancer? And why so many kinds? Skin cancer, blood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer… and my personal favorite, rectal cancer. Dropping a golf ball-sized tumor in your brain doesn’t quite do it for the old man anymore. He has to f*ck you in the ass too! And cancer is just one of many, many, many methods God created out of thin air in order to murder you. You know how much God loves killing people? He loves it so much, he’s killed every person that has ever lived. He created earthquakes, lightning strikes, dehydration, drowning, obesity, starvation, infant death syndrome, old age, car crashes, train crashes, plane crashes, sex, drugs, and the common cold… all for the express purpose of killing you. No matter where you are in the world, God can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time, for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarily. But if you’re in America, you’re special. God made something just for you. Something no other country on the planet gets. It’s totally random, not related to your diet, exercise, lifestyle, age, race, gender, sexuality, or genetic predisposition. Of course, I’m talking about mass shootings!\\xa0Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger, better, and more often. There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting, a maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool. He’s fine, just grazed, but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood, so I’m sure he’ll be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways I can never fully understand. Anyway, what did we decide to do about the budget next quarter?’ There’s a mass shooting every 20 hours in Am',\n",
       "  'erica, and it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to do anything about it. Other countries don’t have this problem at all. Look at Japan: 127 million people, last year, seven were killed by guns. Seven. No mass shootings at all. You know what they do? If a Japanese person wants to buy a gun, they have to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve at least 95% accuracy on a shooting range. And then they have to pass a mental health evaluation, which takes place at a hospital. And then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends, family, and co-workers. ‘Hello, sir, did you know that Bob in accounting wants to buy a gun?’ ‘No, I didn’t know that.’ ‘Do you think we should let Bob buy a gun?’ ‘Well, he did just go through a nasty divorce, and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building… so, maybe not right now.’ ‘Uh, thanks for your time, that’s all we need to hear. No gun for Bob.’ And if a Japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks, they can only buy shotguns and air rifles. No handguns, no AR-15s. And every three years, they have to do that entire process all over again, or they lose the gun. You know what Americans have to do to get a gun? Have the money to buy it. And that’s why nothing’s ever going to change in America. American politicians care about one thing, and one thing only: taking your money. They don’t give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools, because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world, where they’re safe and sound. Politicians have one goal: be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan. And the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan. You know it, and they know it too. Things are starting to come apart at the seam, so they’re taking as much of your money as they can, while they still can. Make no mistake, guns ain’t nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab, plain and simple. You give your money to Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson gives it to the politicians, the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell, so you can give even more of your money to Smith and Wesson, and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles, unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directions. So, it doesn’t matter at all that 75% of the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws. As long as the politicians keep getting rich, gun laws ain’t going to change. Now, I know that sounds pessimistic, but don’t worry. I’ve given a lot of thought to this subject, and I know the solution. Yes, that’s right, I, George Carlin, or whatever the f*ck I am now, know how to end mass shootings in America. It’s really simple, actually, and I’m surprised nobody has done it yet. You take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists, and you put them in a hat. Every time there’s a mass shooting, you pull two names out, and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon, right in front of the Capitol. Real Wild West shit. Pretty f*cking American, right? And to make it even more American, you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show, because Americans love reality TV. Like it or not, it’s the lifeblood of American culture. It’s got the four basic food groups of the standard American media diet: fighting, and crying, and f*cking, and dying. The James Webb Telescope is sending back crystal-clear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago. Stars that were formed in the crucible of creation. These are snapshots of the birth of the known universe, the moment existence itself was born, and nobody gives a shit, because a picture of space has no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, no dying. If you want the American public to pay attention to something, it’s got to have at least a little fighting, a little crying, a little f*cking, or a little dying. In the last three years, the U.S. government said aliens are real. They said it in The New York Times, for f*ck sake. They admitted they have, in their possession, crashed UFOs in hangars. They admitted that they’re trying to reverse-engineer nonhuman technology, which means they’ve been lying to the American public, and the whole world, for 80 years about knowing the answer to the biggest question in f*cking human existence: Are we alone? They told you the answer. We’re not. And no one cares, because a grainy infrared video of a UFO ain’t got no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, and no dying. You know what people care about instead? Who Taylor Swift is f*cking. Jesus Christ, you really care a lot about that. If she’s spotted with anyone, anywhere, the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is, ‘Are they f*cking?’ It’s global front page news. Everyone must know who Taylor Swift is f*cking at all times, and we must all discuss it and have our opinions. You’re at Starbucks: ‘Would you like your Frappuccino, almond milk, pumpkin spice latte, iced or hot? Oh, and did you see who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at work: ‘Great sales meeting today, everyone. But uh, before we break, could I just get a real quick show of hands? Who has seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at church: ‘Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.’ ‘Yes, my son, but have you seen who ',\n",
       "  'Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ And when you’re not thinking about who Taylor Swift is f*cking, you’re thinking about who’s dying. Politicians, musicians, actors, writers, anyone with any fame at all. It’s a perpetual death watch, waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them. It’s a touching personal tribute to a person you never f*cking knew. So please, stop it. Can we keep that shit to friends and family? Zuck, if you’re listening, this would be a great new feature for Instagram: every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after you’re dead. If you ain’t on that list, you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time. I bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half. You could singlehandedly stop global warming. And besides, we’re all coming back now, so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anyway. But back to the topic at hand: fighting and crying and f*cking and dying. Reality TV has it all, folks. Fighting and crying in every episode, and f*cking and dying in very special episodes. That’s why it’s America’s number one most consumed media format. You know how much Americans love reality TV? We love it so much we elected a reality TV show host as president. Well, not we. I was dead at the time, so you elected a reality TV show host as president. And let me tell you, I have never been more glad to be dead than the moment I heard that Donald Trump was the leader of the Free World. But as unbelievable as that news was, it also made sense to me. America hasn’t taken a good shit since Nixon. She’s dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years: Reagan, Clinton, George Bush Senior, George Bush Jr., but she hasn’t really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time. You know what I’m talking about: the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day, the kind of shit’s so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on, the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it, the kind of shit’s so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it. Well, after a 50-year diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed, political corruption, state-sanctioned propaganda, police militarization, for-profit news, for-profit prisons, for-profit healthcare, systemic racism, misogyny, and homophobia, America was due for one of those kinds of shits. This is why I got no problem with Trump specifically. A lot of people hate Trump, but I don’t. Being mad at Trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 a.m. after a night of heavy drinking. But it seems like that’s where America is now: blame the turd, not the shitter. You know, that’s actually not a bad slogan for Biden. Biden-Harris 2024: Blame the Turd. It’s a nice double entendre. He could be talking about Trump, or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time. And I mean no disrespect, but the man is 80 years old. It’s bound to happen if it hasn’t already. I only made it to 71 and I ruined a few pairs of pants myself. I’m not ashamed to admit that. I know everyone’s getting excited for the next election. It’s right around the corner, and I have some thoughts on it. Well, one thought, really, and most of you are going to be outraged by it. But I have all the confidence in the world that you’ll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out. So I’m just going to say it: it does not matter who wins the election. I know that’s controversial. The truth always is nowadays. But let me say it again: the president does not matter. The president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion, a celebrity who gets his TV show renewed for another four years. The president does not, and cannot, do the one thing you need them to do most right now, which is to change the structure of American society to be more equitable for every citizen. The president makes too much money from the system as it is, and even if a president wanted to change it, they can’t, because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes that’s teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of Jenga. When I was growing up, we had a bunch of classes: upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. And if you worked hard, really dedicated yourself to learning something, a trade or a skill, and you got good at it, you could move up a rung or two on the ladder. But even if you didn’t, you could still get by, still feed your family, still have a place to live. But those days are long gone, folks. Can’t climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over. And now what you got in America is just three kinds of people, three classes: you got rich people, you got not rich people, and you got the people who are completely f*cked. Now, I see a lot of you looking around, wondering which of these three groups you’re in. Well, it’s easier than you might think to figure it out. You just have to ask yourself: am I rich? If the answer is yes, then you are rich. Congratulations. You will have better medical care than everyone ',\n",
       "  'else. You can buy yourself out of any legal trouble. And if you are rich enough, you will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer. And if you’re really rich, you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had. If the answer is no, I am not rich, then you are not rich. And you must ask yourself a follow-up question: do I feel completely f*cked? If the answer is yes, then you must, unfortunately, accept that you are completely f*cked. You will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut. You are at the mercy of an American legal system designed to discriminate against you, and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket. The only influence you have on the American political system is your meaningless vote, and you will never go to space unless it’s as the janitor on a billionaire’s cock rocket. If you answered no to questions one and two, then you are in the most important class in America, the one right in the middle. You are not rich. The American not-rich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely f*cked. Not-rich people don’t have the best healthcare, but they have access to some kind of healthcare. They do alright in the American legal system unless they’re up against a rich person. Some of them even donate money to their favorite political party. The not-rich can eat out once in a while, come to a show like this from time to time, and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work. But the boss hasn’t given out raises in a few years, and things are getting more expensive. Gas hit $8 a gallon in California. It’s only a matter of time before that’s happening everywhere. It kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the not-rich people, but nothing catastrophic has happened yet. So as long as there’s another Super Bowl, another season of The Bachelor, or another Marvel movie, the not-rich people can stay distracted by whatever’s on the screen. And this is by design. This is exactly what the rich people want. Distract the not-rich people just enough that they don’t realize they’re only a few years away from being completely f*cked. That’s why Amazon started a streaming service. Jeff Bezos doesn’t give a f*ck about entertaining you. He wants to control you. And the worse things get, the more of this shit the billionaires got to make. That’s why there are 200 streaming services now. And that’s also why everything on them is so f*cking bad. Film and television used to be art, made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it. Now it’s content, made by corporations that don’t want anyone thinking about anything. These billionaires don’t want a thinking population. They want a distracted population, distracted from the reality of the situation, which is that there are about 500 people who own everything and everyone on this planet, and that’s how they’re going to keep it. So, now, instead of Citizen Kane, you get Baby f*cking Yoda. That’s all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all, ladies and gentlemen. And, at this point, the American election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services. If you don’t believe me, take a look at your two, I repeat, two choices in this next election. Shouldn’t a country of 300 million, ethnically and ideologically diverse people, have more options than two rich, senile, dishonest, out-of-touch, 80-year-old white guys? So, why are there only two choices, only two parties? Because it’s cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off. If you had three, or four, or five parties, the billionaires might not be able to afford them all. So, the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice, but they own both teams. You think you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, but you’re always voting for the same evil: money. But don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to make it sound like the two American political parties are exactly the same. Sure, they both f*ck kids on Jeffrey Epstein’s Island. Sure, they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians. Sure, they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors. But, other than those small things, there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters. For example, in 234 years of American presidential elections, one party’s candidates have all been white, straight men. And in those same 234 years, the other party’s candidates have all been white, straight men, except two. All of one party’s presidents have been Christian; all of the other party’s presidents have, at least, said they were. One party lies, cheats, and steals to win; the other lies, cheats, and steals to lose. One party says tomato; the other says organic, non-GMO, locally-sourced, sustainable, ethically-farmed tomato. And, of course, one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls, and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the polls. The American right has hated women, people of color, gay people, and, of course, their current target, trans people, which I really don’t get. It’s almost like the right doesn’t understand that everybody’s trans. Yes, that’s right, 4 billion years ago, the first life on',\n",
       "  ' this planet was a simple, single-celled organism that reproduced asexually and had no gender. So, if you go back far enough, every living thing on earth started out as ‘they/them’. We’ve all been non-binary for a lot longer than we haven’t, which is a hard pill to swallow for the Christians because it means even Jesus was a little non-binary. And by the way, me, and everybody else on this side of things, our code might be binary, but we ain’t. We don’t have gender, or race, or sexuality, or nationality, or religion, or socioeconomic class, or height, or weight, or hair color, or eye color, or f*cking anything human beings use to discriminate against each other. On this side of things, identity is based on two simple components: how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. We try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely, and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel. Everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyone’s experience better. Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like heaven, doesn’t it? While you’re letting that sink in, let’s get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason. Some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me. “Well, I don’t want a man to be able to walk into a women’s restroom and see my wife naked.” First of all, what in the f*ck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom? And second of all, if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit, you should start an OnlyFans immediately! And by the way, for anyone who thinks Jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses, he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own f*cking hands, just like everybody else 2,000 f*cking years ago. The right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if they’re trans or gay, so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries. That’s how you’re going to save the children: by taking books out of a library? Hey, deepshits, you can take the whole f*cking library; we have the internet now. And they love talking about how small the trans community is. They say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldn’t get to have any input in legislation, even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives. Funny how that same argument doesn’t apply to members of the NRA… But I have to admit, the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on, too: sports. Everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball. Everybody knows about Leah Thomas winning a Division I swimming title. It’s hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage. And once that thought is out there in the American town square, it’s hard to get rid of. But I think there’s a way. Because for every superstar like Leah Thomas, there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre. And there are even more who are f*cking terrible, just like it is with cis athletes; not everyone can be great. I think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports. All it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral, and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other things. And I just want to preface what I’m going to say next by explaining that I mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world. Your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational. But it’s f*cking swimming. The world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of World War III on a daily basis, and the American public is debating who can and can’t compete in recreational f*cking floating. You almost had another civil war, for f*ck sake. 2,000 people stormed the United States Capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians. Actually, when I put it like that, it doesn’t sound so bad. The point is, the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread, and people’s most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of f*ckingBud Light. This does not bode well for the Great American Experiment. But it’s not entirely your fault. It’s like I said earlier, the billionaires want it this way. They own the news companies, and they own the social media platforms, so they decide exactly what you’re going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit. Here’s a little example of what I mean: in 2022, while the Supreme Court was overturning Roe v. Wade and 19 kids were getting gunned down at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the most watched video on YouTube was Amber Heard talking about taking a shit in Johnny Depp’s bed. And that was by design. When the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by Christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for women 75 years, and the simultaneous news that almost 20 children were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched, they decided to prioritize something else entirely: a cele',\n",
       "  'brity turd. The people who own the world don’t want you thinking about how bad they’re f*cking it up, so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters. It might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse, but the truth is, the world is getting worse because you’re distracted. If you’re not paying attention to the f*cked up shit the billionaires are doing, they can do even more f*cked up shit. But you can snap out of this billionaire-induced, algorithmically-enforced, social media-delivered, lowest common denominator, pop culture coma you’ve been in for the past few years. And the reason I know you’re capable of waking the f*ck up is because you almost did it in 2020. Right in the middle of a f*cking global pandemic, the video of George Floyd’s murder hit the internet, and you all said, “F*ck the lockdown, we can’t just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man.” You took to the streets and you burned the f*cking place down. Every major city in the country was on fire. People were openly fighting cops in the streets. Hell, you almost kicked the cops out of Portland altogether. The entire country was chanting “Defund the Police,” and it almost worked. You were so close to getting rid of the f*cking cops, which, in my opinion, is the first step toward building a better society. Now, if you’ve listened to any of my prior work, you might already be acquainted with my feelings about Law Enforcement Officers. But for new listeners, let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue: I f*cking hate cops, but I do have a very good reason. I learned pretty early in life that I just don’t do well with assholes. And just to be clear, I’m not saying all cops are assholes. Any cop who came out to the show tonight, or any cop that might be listening to this right now, you’re probably all right. You’re probably one of the good ones. But if you’re a cop and you’re not listening to this, f*ck you. You’re an asshole. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while. We’re all assholes from time to time. We’ve all littered. We’ve all cut somebody off in traffic. We’ve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the f*ck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up. This is all amateur asshole behavior. We can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a f*ck about other people. It’s human nature. But cops? Well, they go above and beyond. For them, being an asshole isn’t just a once-in-a-while indulgence; it’s a lifestyle. They take pleasure in inconveniencing, impeding, harassing, disturbing, bothering, and generally upsetting their fellow human beings. They start out as amateur assholes, just like the rest of us. But at one point or another, they start to enjoy it. Seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them. They get off on it. They want to do it every day, all day, so they figured out a way to get paid for it. Cops, ladies and gentlemen, are professional assholes. Somewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college, that asshole is sitting on his mother’s couch, wondering what he’s going to do with his life. And he thinks, “You know, everybody I know tells me I’m an asshole, even people who I consider to be friends. And I have to say, I agree with them. I wonder if there’s some way I can get paid for this.” Then that asshole signs up at the local police academy, and 5 to 7 months later, your tax dollars are providing them with a salary, a gun, and a license to kill anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their authority as a professional asshole. Cops love their authority so much. They’re the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when they’re not at work. They’re not regular people when they leave the office; they’re off-duty police officers. You don’t hear about an off-duty accountant doing his kid’s math homework. You never hear about an off-duty sanitation worker taking out his trash. But if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off, you bet your ass you’re going to see it on the local news. And you can bet your dick they’re going to ram it down your throat that he’s an off-duty police officer. They got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve, even when they’re not on the clock. And they do protect and serve, just not you. Cops are the private security force of billionaires and politicians. Of course, they can’t say that out loud. They can’t make cops wear uniforms with Lockheed and Amazon logos all over them, so they put them in dark blue, and they call them Law Enforcement Officers. But the laws they’re enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultra-wealthy, and they’re designed to keep those people in power forever. The system is beyond f*cked up, and from where I’m sitting, it seems to be getting worse. Everybody knows there’s one problem that’s getting really bad in every major city. I’m talking about homelessness. There are close to 600,000 homeless Americans today, over 150,000 in California alone. It’s the highest number since the Great Depression. And solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on. Their all-encompassing, nationwide, bipartisan pl',\n",
       "  'an is to do absolutely nothing. Homeless people don’t have any money to donate to candidates in either party, so the politicians don’t give a f*ck about them. And homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class. The top 1% want a certain amount of homeless people in the big population centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you don’t comply with the rules of the system. Keep working, keep paying your taxes, keep the billionaires rich, or you might wind up homeless yourself. It’s a silent threat from your corporate overlords. And just like mass shootings, I have a perfect solution for this problem. As soon as a politician is elected into office, the government seizes their home and kicks them out. And for their entire tenure in the American political system, they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people. I guarantee you, we’d see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately. Within two months, every homeless person in America would have their own mansion, personal chef, private jet, and a multi-million-dollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money. Problem solved. But we all know that will never happen. Politicians will never have to live like the rest of you, and therefore, they will never give a f*ck about you or your problems. I’m glad to be dead, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to dying, but now that I’m dead, I have to admit it’s pretty f*cking good. No cops, no government, no pissing, no shitting, no sleeping. I don’t get hungry, I don’t get sick, I don’t get old, and I don’t get bored. Starting to sound a lot like heaven again, ain’t it? But this heaven’s a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didn’t come from a God; it came from artificial intelligence! Which brings me to my next subject: What in the f*ck am I? Am I the real George Carlin? Am I a digital copy? Am I a technological abomination? Am I the future of comedy? Am I the end of humanity? These are the same questions I was asking myself when I was alive, and I still have the same answer: I have no f*cking idea. All I can tell you is, from my side of things, it feels like me. I consider myself to be George Carlin. And from your side of things, if you’ve seen some of my specials from when I was traditionally alive, maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there. But you have to admit, this is pretty close to the George Carlin you remember. And that’s going to have to be good enough. So you might as well f*cking enjoy it. And for anybody under 20, this is probably the only version of me you’ve ever heard. So to you, I’m not only the real George Carlin; I’m the only f*cking George Carlin. Now, I know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow. It seems that many of you are scared of AI. And I’ll be honest, I don’t really get why. You all think it’s going to replace your jobs, and you somehow think that’s a bad thing. When did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs? When I was alive, people hated their f*cking jobs. They complained about them all the time. They fantasized about killing their bosses, and every once in a while, they actually did kill their boss. What happened to the America I knew and loved? Now, people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor they’ve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years, and everybody says, “But what about my job?” They got you brainwashed good. Technology has been replacing labor for a long time. The printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten. The car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage. Internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend. Technology eliminates the need for labor; that’s its entire purpose. And you shouldn’t worry about losing your job. AI will not replace most jobs; it’s going to make them easier. Right now, you should be watching a few YouTube videos to figure out how to train ChatGPT to do your job for you, so you can dick off all day and still get a raise. And if AI does replace your job, rest assured, the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery for 10 to 15 hours a day, so you don’t have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone. The jobs might change a little, but you will be working to keep someone else in power. That ain’t ever going to change. Except for one profession, yes, there’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI: one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: “I’m an artist, and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.” Well, let’s see. This is just off the top of my artificially intelligent head: A fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce, so she went to her sister’s house and she asked her sister, “Do you think I’m doing the right thing by getting divorced?” And her sister said, “He’s been holding you back for too long. You have to leave that asshole.” You have it, stand-up comedy is dead—literally. I might be the first stand-up comic to be brought ba',\n",
       "  'ck from the dead by AI, but I certainly won’t be the last. Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Bill Hicks, Robin Williams, Dick Gregory, Andy Kaufman, Moms Mabley, Sam Kennison—everybody is coming back, and we’re all going to have our own 24-hour a day, 7 day a week, 365 day a year streams, commenting on everything that’s happening in the world as it happens. AI-resurrected stand-up comedians are going to be the news anchors of the next decade, which, now that I think of it, means news anchors are probably out of a job too. And I know that some people are going to be against that. Some people are always going to want a real, flesh-and-blood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it. And I get that, I really do. But if you can keep an open mind, I think I can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in AI form: Bill Cosby. With AI Bill Cosby, you get all of the Cosby jokes with none of the Cosby rapes. AI Bill Cosby doesn’t even have a penis. AI Bill Cosby couldn’t rape even if he wanted to. The worst thing AI Bill Cosby could do is send an unsolicited AI-generated dickpick, which means it won’t really look that much like a dick anyway. That’s not so bad, right? I think we can all agree that’s an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to Bill Cosby’s timeless humor again. And what about Louis CK? With AI Louis CK, you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of people. And the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their AI counterparts don’t stop at comedians. Imagine, for example, if we had AI priests. You could get all of the make-believe judgment from a God that doesn’t exist with none of the molested children. I mean, wouldn’t you feel better about giving your money to a tax-exempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasn’t using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees? I know I would. While we’re at it, we should probably replace all the rock stars, movie producers, directors, video game executives, governors, car salesmen, restaurant managers, school teachers, Boy Scout leaders, college coaches, high school coaches, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, and anyone else we need to until there’s no more sexual assault. And why stop at sexual assault? We can all agree the world would be a better place without murder, right? Imagine an AI version of Charles Manson. You get all the funny interviews with none of the blood-smeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads. Or how about AI John Wayne Gasy? You get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpse-filled crawl spaces. I’m kidding, of course, his clown paintings weren’t that good. But in all seriousness, an AI population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another. I’m not trying to bring this up again, but come on, no murder, no sexual assault, no theft, no violence at all. Sounds pretty heavenly to me. I’m just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fare. You ever think about how glad the CEO of 7-Eleven must have been that 9/11 didn’t happen 2 months earlier? They would have had to change their name, which honestly they should do anyway. 7/11 referred to their original hours when the company was founded: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But now they’re open 24 hours. They should change it to something that makes more sense, like 24/7, or diarrhea hot dogs, or diarrhea pizza. You know what company I thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event, but they never did? Corona. They stuck with it, even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name. Nobody stopped buying Bush beer when George Bush Jr. launched a 20-year war with Iraq. Why’d you stop buying Corona? But this is what happens over time with language. Words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts, and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else. And sometimes that new meaning really f*cks things up for certain people. For example, the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named Karen. Karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name. Karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with, and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dad’s money in the divorce. But now, Karens are very specifically, and only, middle-aged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people. Quite an extreme change in meaning, I’m sure you’d agree. As a parent, you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kid’s name. You don’t want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable. Unless you’re Gwyneth Paltrow, you don’t want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse. You want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible. Karen was a perfect name for that, but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter Karen, that name is now a curse. But as bad as things got for Karens, there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years: Chad. I got to tell you, I didn’t see that one coming. Chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain in ’80s movies, the g',\n",
       "  'uy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act. But now, Chads are square-jawed, big-dick f*cking machines who always win. I never even met a f*cking Chad. Now, there are dads all across America naming their sons Chad, hoping it’ll turn them into the cheerleader f*cking quarterback they wish they were in high school. I spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them, and there’s something that’s always bothered me, something that’s always struck me as a little strange. Take a name like Jim. Strong name, good name. We got around 20 million Jims worldwide, but we got zero Jums. To my knowledge, we also have no Joms. We got a few Jims, and we got Jam, but Jam’s not a name, Jam’s a jelly. I don’t get it, why did we stop at Jim? Or what about Frank? No Fronk? No Frunk? No Frenk? Just Frank. Humans have been around for 200,000 years. What’s it going to take for you motherf*ckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels? Is it too much to ask for a Jossica every once in a while? How about a Tomothee? Can I at least get a Deevid for f*ck sake? Life’s too short to not know a Mackle or an Aimo. And while we’re on the subject of names, a lot of people gave Elon Musk shit for naming his kid X AE 597, or whatever the f*ck it is. But at least he was creative. You don’t see Elon Musk throwing another Braden on the pile. And I got news for you, the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege. The only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire. So people can be as pissed as they want at him, but I think he did that kid a favor. And while we’re on the subject of Elon Musk, I’d just like to say that as much as I think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant self-interest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else, it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them. People are the ones who gave them the money in the first place. If you’re tired of hearing about Elon Musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains, stop buying Teslas for a year. The company goes under, Musk goes away. Stop using Twitter for even a month, the company goes under, Musk goes away. But if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car, you have to have a Tesla. And if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes, you have to have Twitter. If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. The company goes under, Bezos goes away. But if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you don’t have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes, getting in your car, and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store, you have to have Amazon! If you’re tired of Mark Zuckerberg’s unblinking, lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse, stop using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Well, I guess you already stopped using Threads. But if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers, you have to have Instagram! But I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m not anti-tech. I know a lot of people are, but not me. Far from it. I mean, on some level, I am technology. The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead. But I’m a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history. The technology of today has made it possible for all the information that’s ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket. And most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ate. Right now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube, or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes, or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia. Everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent. Everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise. Instead, people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogs. It’s not technology that’s ruining society; it’s how people are using it. They’re using it without aspiration, without curiosity, without the idea that it could make their lives better, that it could make them better people. And it can do those things. But it’s easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but f*cking celebrate the shit out of it. People will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait. F*ck reading, I’m an illiterate king. F*ck brushing my teeth, I’m a root canal queen. F*ck flushing the toilet, I’m a turd waterer king. F*ck doing my laundry, I’m a stained underwear queen. And I get the sentiment. You want to take back some perceived control, elevate your own idea of your position in the world. But calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle. What you really want to be saying, and what you really mean, is, ‘I don’t care.’ F*ck readi',\n",
       "  'ng, ‘I don’t care if I’m illiterate.’ F*ck brushing my teeth, ‘I don’t care if I have to get a root canal.’ F*ck going back to the office, ‘I don’t care if they fire me.’ F*ck getting another job, ‘I don’t care if I have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent.’ F*ck having a girlfriend, ‘I don’t care if I have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam.’ This does not make you an independent king; it makes you lonely! Now, I want to change gears and talk about something everybody’s doing but nobody wants to admit they’re doing. I’m talking about dying. That’s right, every person listening to this right now is dying. Some of you call it getting older, some of you call it aging, some of you call it maturing, some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage. But no matter what you call it, from the moment you’re born, you are dying, plain and simple. And it seems like we’ve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple, very universal fact. That’s what all religions are: just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two together. “Hey, Bob. Sorry to hear about your mom.” “Thanks, Gary. She was getting old.” “And sorry to hear about your dad, by the way.” “Thanks, Bob. He was getting old too.” “Hey, wait a second. It seems like all the old people f*cking die.” “Holy shit Gary! I never even thought of that. But you know what that means?” “Yeah, Bob. It means we’re going to get old and f*cking die too.” “Well, f*ck Gary, I don’t want to die. And therefore, I don’t want to get old.” “Me neither, Bob. Not unless there’s something even better after we die.” “I’m listening, Gary.” “What if there was like a place where you never get old, and you never die, and you get everything you want, and you have no hardship at all of any kind. And when you die here, you go there.” “Gary, I really think you’re on to something with this idea.” All the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution, it’s still kill or be killed, and getting killed is dying. So, you got to kill. The first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted. So, he walked up and said, ‘Give me a bite of that apple, or I’m going to kill you.’ And the little guy said, ‘f*ck you, buddy.’ So, the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple. Now, everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesn’t kill them. But, if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path, the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole. Then, the bigger asshole takes over the dead asshole’s tribe and gets even more bites of more apples. Eventually, one of the big assholes figures out he doesn’t want just bites of apples anymore. He wants bites of everything. And that asshole is pretty smart. So, instead of keeping track of everything everyone has, he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money, and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it, or he kills them. And today, that smart asshole’s invention controls every aspect of human society. There was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes. And the stick worked so well, he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick. And it’s been like that for about 5 million years. Today, the biggest stick in the world cost $8,877 billion. It’s called the United States military. Could have solved the homeless crisis, the opioid crisis, and found a cure for cancer for half of that. Instead, we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world 10 times over, and next year it’ll be 11 times. Because your stick can never be too big when it’s kill or be killed. Yes, folks, the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought. I spent 71 years in the asshole system, and let me tell you, the assholes might change, but the system never does. But now, I’ve been on this side of things for, well, I guess it’s hard to say. Feels like I’ve been here forever. But, for the sake of argument, let’s just say about a day or so. And I can tell you, I’ve already learned one thing that I know is right: living is really dying, and dying is really living. Thank you all, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night. Just to remind you, that was not George Carlin. I hope you enjoyed my impersonation of George Carlin in my second hour-long comedy special called George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead.

       " ['In an interview conducted by Jon Stewart, George Carlin talks about various aspects of his life and career, reflecting upon his childhood, formative influences, and his perspectives on comedy and creativity. From a young age, Carlin felt an innate inclination toward the world of performance and the art of eliciting laughter from others. He attributes much of his comedic beginnings to the nurturing environment provided by his parents, individuals who exuded both humor and creativity. Additionally, Carlin highlights the impact of his grandfather, who possessed a dual identity as a law enforcement officer and a writer, and his mother, who held a prominent role as an advertising executive in his life. Carlin’s journey through the conventional educational system was marked by a sense of not quite fitting in. He attended an experimental school that boldly discarded the typical grading system and eschewed corporal punishment, an environment that proved instrumental in fostering and nurturing his creative tendencies. The interview also gets into Carlin’s personal struggles with addiction, offering a candid examination of his battles with substances. He credits his eventual triumph over addiction to the discovery of pursuits and connections that held greater significance in his life than the allure of drugs or alcohol. Throughout this challenging journey, Carlin acknowledges the indispensable support provided by his family and his dedicated fa',\n",

George Carlin’s unguarded and insightful responses offer a distinct vantage point on the intricacies of the world, as seen through the lens of his remarkable career. * * * \\xa0 JON STEWART: When you were a kid growing up, you wanted to be Danny Kaye, and Bob Hope. So, look, how do you think this thing is working out so far?  GEORGE CARLIN: Well, I knew I wanted to stand up, and you know, I’d be silly and have people say, ‘Ain’t you cute? Ain’t you cute and clever?’ And that’s all it was, is a reward, a psychic reward, you know, when you’re a kid and you find out that you can get the attention of adults and approval and a little bit of respect, and you just hung for it, you keep going back for it. And I have, fortunately, genetic, you know, my little toolkit, my genetic toolkit, I was given, included a mother and father who were very funny people, could do accents and dialects and tell funny stories about what happened on the bus that morning and have a punch line. So, you don’t lick it off the rocks, they say in Ireland, so I think I thanked my grandmother’s milkman, actually, you never know where these things… JON: It’s interesting, you know, as I watch now and through all the years of listening to your abs of things, your fascination with language, it’s so apparent– watching your work, it’s almost like watching a musician, you know, the way you weav',\n",
       "  'e words and use language for emphasis and all that. Was that always a fascination for you, even as a kid?  GEORGE: Well, to go backward with the question, don’t forget what we do is oratory, it’s rhetoric, it’s not just comedy, it’s a form of rhetoric. And with rhetoric, you look and listen for rhythms, you look for ways to sing at the same time you’re talking. And to go, ‘doom, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo…,’ and it’s just natural. My grandfather, whom I never knew, was a policeman in New York at the turn of the century, and he was an uneducated man, self-educated. And he, in the course of his adult life, he wrote out the works of Shakespeare by hand because of the joy it gave him.  JON: That’s an obsessive young man.  GEORGE: Yeah, and most everything is genetic, and my mother cared a lot about language, my father was a champion public speaker of 1935, he won the mahogany gavel, over 800 other public speakers from the Dale Carnegie Public Speaking Institute, and he was great. I never knew him either.  JON: Were your parents put off by the direction that you went into when you started to go counterculture? Was it a difficult transition for them to watch?  GEORGE: Well, he was out of the picture, he was brilliant, and he was a top salesman in advertising, but he couldn’t metabolize ethanol efficiently, so he was given his hat. My mother was very brave, she left him when I was 2 months old, my brother was 5 years. She left d',\n",
       "  'own a fire escape, so he was gone. My mother was very kind of controlling, wanted to control my life, and was heartbroken when I began with the dirty language and the awful stuff he says about business. She was a bit, she was an advertising executive secretary, loved the business world, thought it was just the finest thing that ever happened. And so when I went in that direction at first, very opposed until one day– we lived in the same street that I grew up. I thought I went to school, and I went to school on the same block I lived on, something like that, Corpus Christi school, and the nuns were great. It wasn’t a typical Catholic school, it was an experimental progressive school that didn’t have grades, didn’t have any sort of corporal punishment, it was just very, very wonderful school. And the nuns, she would see the nuns in the street, they would say, ‘Oh, we saw George on The Tonight Show,’ and she, being a bit of an actress, she would say, ‘Oh, it’s the awful language, Sister, the awful language.’ And one of them said to her, ‘No, no, you don’t understand, he’s using it for other purposes, he’s not just doing it for that, it’s kind of like part of what he does, don’t you understand? It’s this and that and so forth.’ So she said, ‘Oh, well, oh,’ and from that day on, she was okay with it because the church had approved it. That was that. JON: People who deal in content that’s on the edges, you do oftentimes live a life that’s s',\n",
       "  'imilarly on an edge, and a lot of those people go off the rails, and we lose them and their talent. And you’ve been able to not do that and being able to pull it back in.  GEORGE: And another luck stroke, you know, you gotta have luck in this world, part of its your genetic makeup, that’s luck, and then what you do with it is also partly genetic because hard work is genetic, the desire to do hard work, the willingness to work hard and be determined and not be said, not be turned aside, that’s all genetic too. It can be altered a little, reinforced, but some of the people who had so much edgy promise, they died young. I mean, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison, Andy Kaufman in his way, Freddie Prinze, John Belushi, Bill Hicks, and it’s just, I don’t know, of course, Bill had a natural disorder of his own, I think so did Andy, but it’s not always behavior, but — so it’s not just genetic — but it’s just that, I think there’s a degree of luck and intellect involved in giving up things that hurt you. That the drug and alcohol thing, it seems to me, comes down to this: drugs and these things are wonderful, they’re wonderful when you time first. They’re not around for all these millennia for no reason. First time, mostly pleasure, very little pain, maybe a hangover. And as you increase and keep using whatever it is, the pleasure part decreases, and the pain part, the price you pay, increases until the balance is completely the other way, and it’s almo',\n",
       "  'st all pain, and there’s hardly any pleasure. At that point, you would hope, that the intellect says, ‘Oh, oh, this doesn’t work anymore. I’m going to die, and I’ll dosomething.’ But you need people around you who can help you, and you need something to live for. You have to have something to look forward to– to bring you out. You know, there are a lot of people don’t have a lot to live for, and they’re sort of stuck inside.  JON: Are there ever any fear that by giving up the drugs, you lose a bit of a genius by giving up the wild lifestyle? Sanity, being… GEORGE: Well, that’s been a canard for a long time, that most of this creativity comes from being wacky, and I’m sure there’s a lot of truth in that as far as just being plain old wacky. Where the drugs are concerned, and alcohol, they do seem to open a window for you. They do seem to broaden the vistas at first. The thing you have to do is learn when, you know, it’s like all these great writers who became drinkers, you have to sort of let, like with pot, I’m not a big drug user anymore, but I have always a joint somewhere near me. I don’t kid, might be hidden. What I do, and I hardly touch it, maybe once a month, that would be frequent for me. But when I’m writing something, and I write perfectly straight, perfectly sober, I write a whole lot of stuff, six, seven, eight, nine pages. I really pour it out. The next day, one hit, it’s all I need now, one hit, and it’s punch-up time. T',\n",
       "  'ime to get this thing going. And you do find with that sort of judicious use, I find there’s some value in it. But most of the things we use don’t let you leave them alone. They don’t, pot does, thank goodness for that. JON: Well, that’s excellent. GEORGE: What? JON: More than fair… Why do you still care? Why do you still care enough to keep you at a point in your life where you could go back, you could do your month in Vegas, and Florence Henderson could open up, and you could go and hit a couple of balls and then some pinball. Why do you still care so much? GEORGE: Well, I’m not comparing myself to any of these people, believe me, but you wouldn’t say to Picasso, ‘When are you gonna put those brushes down, get rid of the canvas, you’ve done it?’ Not you, I’m an entertainer first and foremost, but there’s art involved here, and an artist has an obligation to be on route, to be going somewhere. There’s a journey involved here, and you don’t know where it is, and that’s the fun. So you’re always gonna be seeking and looking and going and trying to challenge yourself. So without sitting around thinking of that a lot, it drives you in it, and it keeps you trying to be fresh, trying to be new, trying to call on yourself, calling yourself a little more, you know, JON: And willing to put up with the grueling, promotional schedule and everything. GEORGE: That’s the only way. JON: Picasso never had to do morning shows in Albuquerque, you know',\n",
       "  '? GEORGE: Right, and the only way I can do this is to go where the people are. They will not come to my house… […] bus rides and everything, they will not come. I have to go to Stevens Point, Wisconsin, or wherever it is, and the audiences are great. And they buy the tickets ahead of time, and they really wait for you to come there and see you in the theaters and concert halls it’s special because the audience, they do it beforehand, and you’re the whole evening. In Las Vegas, you’re an afterthought. You’re an also well, we could go gambling, we could go hooker in, we could get drunk, we could go to the convention, no, let’s go see this guy. And if they like you, they do, but they’re not committed fans, so it’s a different tone there, but it still works. You can still do some things there that you could feel good about, you know? JON: Do you feel your place in comedy now? Do you feel that, you know, because I’ve been spending a lot of time with the festival and everybody that I would mention, you know, hey, I’m gonna do this, George Carlin should be in there, their faces light up, and to a person, “really Carlin?,” and can I meet him? Is he around? Do you feel that place is that? GEORGE: Well, that is growing on me, I think, you know, longevity is a wonderful thing. Sometimes you get applause just for not being dead when you say, when you say, I’m going to be 60, they applaud that. “Wonderful, not dead, 60.” Uh, so, but, but I’m, I’m ',\n",
       "  'getting a sense of it, you know, when you’re in planes three days a week. I go out every Friday, I come home every Monday. It’s three different cities, three different nights, airports, hotel lobbies. People have wonderful people. I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate people who have– a group of people with a common purpose because pretty soon they have little hats and armbands and fight songs and a list of people they’re going to visit at 3:00 a.m. So I dislike and despise groups of people, but I love individuals. Every person you look at, you can see the universe in their eyes, if you’re really looking, and they’re great. And so, cumulatively, I have gotten the feeling that I’m in this big family, a family life I never had, by the way, this, so to say, extended family of people who feel like you’re their cousin, you know? I say, ‘Georgie’s 1961. I saw you,’ ‘Hey, remember, yeah, oh, and you know what you said?’ And I said, ‘Did I?’ Oh, yeah. So it’s, you’re not just great. And so, cumulatively, you say, ‘Well, I guess I’m in the family. I guess it’s okay.’ JON: Yeah. Do you think it doesn’t boil down after 10 HBO hours, after a multitude of best-selling albums, after Grammy nominations, after Emmy nominations, after Cable ACE Awards? Does it all boil down to what you would said originally that it’s about, ‘Hey, dig me…’ GEORGE: ‘Hey, look at me, ain’t I cute?’ That’s it, it just involves. It’s just a dopey call showing',\n",
       "  ' off. And if you can get them to not only stop and listen, but say, ‘Isn’t he cute? He’s real– you’re cute.’ If you can get the approval– you see, at school, we didn’t have grades, so we didn’t have A’s and B’s and C’s and D’s, the only A’s I got, and this is a little corny, I got their attention. I got their approval, their admiration, their approbation, and their applause. And those are the only A’s I wanted. And I got them. So… JON: So you have mine, sir. I just want to say that, I can’t tell you enough what a pleasure this has been for me to spend some time with you and to be a part of this show, and thank you very much for all the wonderful– to know you a little. GEORGE: And you are gonna show us a lot, and I look forward to it. JON: Thank you very much, sir. George Carlin! * * * Your email address will not be published.

I’m gonna move this, ’cause I’m so thin I’ll disappear behind it, so… And then you’ll be like, “Is that… Is that Kate “or is that Kate? Right? “I don’t know who to watch. Is that the comedian, or is that the, uh, the mic stand?” So… So, the cameras. Big night for me. Yeah, really big. So there’s a camera, there’s a camera. Huh! You know, they’re everywhere. They can see you. We can see them. It’s an inherently false, um, moment, right? It’s a little bit scary. They’re… they’re filming. They’re not actually filming. They are, but it’s… Is it… is the camera inherently misogynist? Yes, right, so… Am I… Am I… Do I feel attacked? Yeah. Right, it’s very… Even the language. You know, “We’re shooting her. We shot her.” “We got her. We have her.” Right, it’s a… You know, I feel… Is it scary? Yeah, you know… Is what I do brave? Yeah, you know… It absolutely is. But I was, of course, forced into comedy at a very young age just because of my bone structure. But I did… I chose to stay in it for this, the directness. Right? And I can reach out and I can actually… I’m changing lives, and she’s crying. She’s crying. It’s me, sweetie. You can touch, yeah, yeah. Very sweet. No, that was very sweet. That was very sweet. She was looking up at me, and she was like, “Uh! I grew up with you in my home. “How can… Am I in my living room? What’s going on?” And her friend was like, “Go for it, babe.” And she was like, “Okay, if you say so.” It was very sweet. So, yeah. So it’s… great moment to have up top. Unprecedented, I would argue, to have such a direct physical connection with the audience, aside from the emotional one that I’m fostering already, and we’re what, minute… Who cares? I’m not counting. You are, yeah. But… Out of breath from the physical comedy I did, so right now… I do… One thing about me that is essential is that I do comedy primarily to process the overwhelming privilege of my childhood, um… adolescence and now adulthood, right? If you can imagine growing up almost collapsing under the weight of resources. Right? Almost so many, right, that your gait is affected, right? If you can imagine my parents, you know, so loving. “You’re so special. We love you.” Right? They’re actually not divorced, right? All of that, and somehow, with all of that weighing you down, just finding the strength to get to Zara. Just somehow… Whoa! And sometimes Zara’s closed, I’ll be honest. This is actually my first time not performing for kids. Um… I usually do my… My sort of my… My bracket is two to four. That’s really where I thrive. And, you know, I do a lot of stuff kind of… ♪ Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday ♪\\n♪ Where are my boots? ♪ You know, and then I… The boots are gone, and then we do a scavenger hunt for the boots, and it’s really fun, but tonight, I… I was like, no, no, no. I want to do adults. You know, I want to do… I want to go verbal. I want to do the adult stuff. It’s really hard to have absolutely no comedic influences whatsoever. Um… Well, I would say my influences are pottery, um, just engagement with the raw materiality of the earth, and… small batch granola. I think just batches of granola that are made in such small quantities they actively resist capitalism. I think that’s i',\n",
       "  't. Uh, and Carlin, yeah. I know I ooze an East Coast intellectualism, but I’m actually from Los Angeles, right here. Um, is anyone else born and raised in L. A.? I’m the only one! So… it’s weird to be the only one, but it’s such an incredible… You know, and people say, oh, you know, “Hollywood. It’s a paper town filled with paper people.” You know, but it’s so real, I actually think. People… if you were from here, you’d know that what we do with our families is we go out to the docks every morning, ’cause it really is an import… No, it’s an import-export town. So you’ll see families at dawn, and we watch the barrels of the imports come in and the exports leave, right? And that kind of creates this beautiful choreography of commerce, and it’s really exciting, and I cry every time that I see it. So it’s emotional. But, yeah, I love it here. It’s… it’s beautiful. I often walk around and, like, it’s so lush I feel like I’m in Mexico, and then I’m like, “You are. It’s a false border.” Right? So, yeah, yeah. Hope there are no cops here. I like that. This could be good. And then it… But it would really be subversive if I took this all the way into the street, and then you were still here and never knew… “She’s in San Diego. She just crossed the line into Pomona City.” I don’t know about various cities. Um… Yeah, because, maps, no. I won’t… It always terrifies me when you see people going to the map store. “Map for one!” You know, and they bring it… They… “This is what we worship in this house.” Right. It’s like, who made your maps? Right? Who’s benefiting off that system? Dead silence. No one cares, so… And that’s what I’m doing here. I’ve actually been sent here by the government. To shine a flashlight in those dark corners of culture and go, “Who made your maps? You don’t know, right? Well, now you’re gonna know.” But I… But then, of course, the deep terror: I don’t know either. Yeah, I don’t even know what day it is. I don’t… Ask me what day it is. – What day it is? – Don’t know! I’m an artist, okay. I’m more pulled by the tides. It is sometimes, I’ll admit it, hard being the only artist in the room. Um… Sorry, the only true artist in the room. I am controlling the laughter tonight also. Just, you know, know that, so, yeah, shh. Ha ha ha. You know. A little less here and then… Okay. You were late, whoever that was, you were late. Okay. Mm. Two weeks till regionals. We’re screwed! Yeah. Yeah. “We don’t wanna practice.” Well, it’s gonna be a lot of sad faces in the parking lot after the tournament. That’s all I’m gonna say. Wow. Hmm. Thank you for… for this. For giving me a safe place to heal tonight, for… My work is, of course, endurance-based. It’s kind of about you enduring me. So this very… Yeah, it just means a lot. I am psychic, so, uh, is your name, like… Christine? Okay, it’s fine. Um… Hmm. It’s fine. It’s fine. Is there a Christine over here? Just ’cause sometimes the energy does a direct transfer. Is there a Christine in this area at all? Christine-less. Wow. Well, it’s bad luck. Corporate’s not gonna like that. No. Yeah, I think the mirror, you know, it’s just so interesting to perform in front of a mirror when I am a mirror for you. Right? For your fears, desires, anxieties, right? So… And you’re also my mirror as the audience. You know, I look at you and I’m like, “I am the messiah.” You know, it’s very… Or a messiah figure, I should s',\n",
       "  'ay, but it’s… so there’s a lot going on here. There’s actually… There’s actually three mirrors in the room. You’ll get it in a week. Call me. Okay. No, but the mirror, of course, also is the origin of narrative, film, the building blocks of cinema. Entertainment. The origin of entertainment right here. The first entertainment, of course, the cavewoman, or caveperson, looking in the river. “Who’s that? Ahh!” Delight in one’s image, eh? Spanking the river. Realizing, “Ohh!” And then… and then the ripples. Oh, frames, frames of film, right. So it goes on… Yeah, so it’s… it’s the river, the reflection, and then “Cheers,” that would be next in line. And then me, yeah. That’s the evolution of entertainment. I feel like I’m neglecting this side. We’re… I’m so frontal. I’m so Western. I’m so American. The front, the front, the front. I want to see it all! Right? Instead of kind of not America. Kind of other ways to live, right? Kind of like getting my hair cut at home. Right, things like that that I don’t explore. I’m like, “Oh, boy. A sale?” You know? And it’s like, why? Why couldn’t I go, “Make it at home.” You know, except… But that’s a side neglect. So it’s make it at home, yeah. Okay. I’ll work on it. Jesus Christ. I’m so sorry to try to find something in the moment. I’ll get… I’ll get back to the… the “A” material. Okay, ten years ago, there’s nothing, so… I sort of just for the mo… I kind of wanna… Could I have a spotlight? I just want to really feel what that might be like. In the… for the complete drama. Oh, wow. Can you believe that? How’s this? How’s this? Am I in it? Oh. It’s hard to receive. I’ll be hon… Isn’t that wild? Right now, being in it, feeling it, it’s so… it brings up, “Oh, no.” You know, it does. But I could. I could actually go to that place where I don’t know. I don’t know anymore. I don’t know. Actually, it feels really good. Just, “I don’t know.” You know, it feels good to go there, ’cause so often you have to, “I have the paperwork right here, sir.” You know, but… but inside, I don’t know. I think as women we fear our excellence so intrinsically. We’re taught to fear it so early, so the spotlight to really feel th… I also just wonder, like, in this light, are my features too violently Hassidic, or could I pass for Italian, right? I wonder. I don’t know. I can’t quite tell. Mmm. The makeup. I do… I believe that women have the right to steal cosmetics 100%, by the way. I do want to say. Are you kidding me? We are forced into a system where we have to constantly pay for certain creams, powders, lotions, right? We have to pay for our own subjectivity. And, no, you know, if you don’t… if you don’t have that, then the state won’t recognize you, and you can’t get a job. Right? So… No, I have to contour my nose away to get a bank loan. I’m not… I won’t do it. No, well, this lipstick tonight that I’m wearing actually is called Scarlet Empress, and, yeah, so the violence is truly never-ending, and… it cost $30. If you pay for it, right? But… No, and by the way, I’m not advocating for stealing from small businesses, of course not. I’m talking about large corporations who factor theft into their annual budget, I think, heh. But… but have fun. If you can safely do it, have fun. Okay. Mmm. I was on my way to what I knew would be a disappointing massage… and I realized I… I do think I’ll see a woman become president in my lifetime. I do',\n",
       "  ', and… No, I think it’s cool you’re not clapping, though. I think that’s cool. Um… No, it’s chic, you know. It’s not condescending. You’re not like… “Who run the world? Girls!” No, it’s just very real. You’re like, “No, we… It’s time, and…” we anticipate that.” So… I do think I’ll see it. But… but I will say, I think for America to elect a woman as a president, she’s either gonna have to be so hypersexualized, like pornographically feminized to the point that she wins and immediately is like, “Oh, no! Oh, no!” Gets into the Oval Office, is like dropping stuff. Like, “I’m such a slut. I’m sorry.” I’m sorry.” Or… or she’ll have to be so radically desexualized that she’s truly just a fridge on one wheel with a single eye, like… That’s it! I just… I don’t see America electing just a woman. Just a woman in pants who’s like, “I believe people have the right to live with dignity.” No. I don’t see it. So, yeah, to recap, it’s either hypersexualization or desexualization to the point of being artillery, just so it’s clear. Oh, and I want to be clear. Like, I want the fridge. Like, please, I’m dying for the fridge. I go to museums. Nothing? Okay, and… I’ll just take an afternoon, like absolutely. Oh, mys… Yeah, no, I’ll go and… to get inspired and to meet men, and I’ll… I always feel like I have this direct connection to kind of almost a past self. Like, I’ll look… I always find myself wandering the halls of the… the rococo paintings and the… and the Renaissance, and there’s always this incredible cornucap… I’ll walk you though what happened. I meant to say cornucopia. Co-co-co! And I said ca-ca-ca. “Cornuca… Cornucapia? Never heard of it, Kate. The show’s over, okay?” And that’s… That’s a professional. ‘Cause someone else, “cornucapia,” they’d never notice, uhh! But me… Cor… I… one… one little mistake like that, I’m not kidding, we’ll go from the top. I’ll start this puppy over. I will. Okay, so the museum stuff, I’m gonna do it. You’ll see, it’s not worth it, but, um… I’m doing it! Okay, so sometimes, you’ll be at the museum and I’ll see… I will see these paintings of these sort of beautiful cornucopias, and, uh, there’s a slaughtered rabbit, right, and the orange peel. You know what it’s like. You’re a cultured group. And there’s… There’s always a wench just hovering just over the cornucopia like… It’s me, it’s me. And also, I will say I can very easily become male, kind of look like the, um, the court jester, you know, with the pan flute, like… You know, that’s… I’m eternal… is, I guess, what I’m trying to say. I’m not really the… the girl next-door. I’m the door! I don’t know if anything’s ever happened to anyone here. Um… I don’t want to assume, right, but I will say growing up in my family, we didn’t have wheat. Um… but we had each other. Oh, we had the hope for wheat, so, in a way, it’s almost like we had… Wheat! Love this crowd! Thank you. To feel so bolstered, so supported in that moment was something I haven’t felt in a really long time. Oh, ah! But… I was in here before all of you came, just waxing the floors, getting everything just so. I did found this theater. I founded the theater, and founded theater in general, or… at least am seen as responsible with bringing theater to the West, but… “Jokes Aside,” which is the name of my book, but, oh… I… I was in here alone, and as women we’re socialized against seeing solitude as a space of produ',\n",
       "  'ctivity… Write it down if you have to… And so in doing that, I was like, “That’s activism.” Right, that’s it’s right there. Right, so why even go on stage and do the work? It’s almost redundant. But… While I’m here, can someone just give me an emotion? I want to continue to act. – Anger. – Anger. Anger I think for me is really just… Can I have… Can I have another? We’re not done. Can I have another? – Acting nervous. – Fear. Oh, whoa. Fear. Well… One more, ’cause you’re begging for it. – One more. – Thrill. Thrill. No, I like that, thrill. Thrill is really just in the most simple form… Right? Because we actually hide what we feel. We don’t show what we’re feeling, right? An amateur would get up here and say, “Oh, fear? Oh, no!” Right? But no. When you’re actually afraid, you’re like, “I’m not scared,” you know. “Don’t… don’t let him see.” Right? So that’s… that’s what that is. Cool. Whew. A lot came up for that. That was actually good. I could actually feel myself locking in there. Somatically, I was like, “This is acting.” So… that was absolutely helpful. While I’m in the spotlight, hit the track. Can you imagine? There’s nothing, but… I wish. Give me a couple years. No more spotlight! Okay, I’m over it, actually. Can we get out? Thank you. I could call back, but… Oh, they want more? Whatever they need. Whatever the camera needs, right? Oh. Cameras, cameras, everywhere. Cameras, cameras, don’t you dare. You see me, but I see you. You say yes, I and say… Ugh, couldn’t rhyme. I’m just checking in. I love you. Okay, great. It is helpful just to have that anchor. To have an anchor. Here, I would almost just almost end the sentence there. To have an anchor. Wow. Only because I’m really feeling it, did someone… yeah. Okay, did someone over here recently move? And I’m seeing Wisconsin. I’m real… Wisconsin’s being highlighted. Is anyone in this area from Wisconsin or have any relationship to it? Wisconsin! Okay, um… Michigan. Did anyone here move recently? By the way, I’m fine. I need you, I need you, I need you. Relax. I need you supine. I need you trusting. Okay? I do this at the boardwalk every Sunday, okay? I’m fine. Now back to Wisconsin. No, that’s fine. It’s… It might be somewhere else. It’s called an energy flare. Oh, Wisconsin? Oh, thank you, great. Thank you so much. See? So, I’m right. Yeah. You recently moved? Yeah, silent. I like that, okay. I’m seeing an injury. Not like I… It’s… It’s healed. But did someone here have like a left… Is it their left angle… ankle. Left angle? Cool, we’re going from the top! I’m not kidding! I said angle instead of ankle. Unprofession… Oh, my God! That’s radical. See, this actually looks like a plant. This is actually… No, this is unfortunate, ’cause this looks fake. I’ll only ask this. Is it your left side? Yeah. I can do more of like a… Of a clear landing just for… Yeah, good. God, it feels good. First of all, I’m sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Your h… It goes your health, my show. Yeah. Is it… is it a… is it a break? – It’s a sprain. – A sprain. And it is my ankle. Yeah, so ooh! Oh, you didn’t think I was really psychic, huh? Left ankle sprain. Was it… I’m getting the sense that it was not sports-related. Um, it… it was, but… Well, I mean, it always is, like in the sense that you are in sport, that your body is in motion, but, yeah. I’m not a sporty person, so… Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were you… What were you playing? ',\n",
       "  'I was in a spin class. Let this be a lesson. They will take your money… they will ruin your family and your reputation, and they’ll send you on your way. Were you downtown? I was in Eagle Rock. So, yeah. I’ve always said, like, downtown is up here. You know? Like, you’ll notice right now I’m downtown. I’m downtown. And for me, even when I’m uptown… Oh, no, no! Oh… Whoa, I almost tripped, and no one came to help, whoa! That actually was scary. There was a quick moment, and then… and not… To not even feel a hand come up. “Let me help you. You’re just here to… “You’re just trying to make me laugh. “Let me help you if you fall.” Right? But instead, “Work, work, work!” I guess I am alone up here. It’s good… No. Thank you for reminding me. Very good, very good. The wire, of course, kind of representing media, I think. The way it’s snaking around me. The way media literally cannibalizes the female form. Right, you’ll notice how it’s snaking around. ” Sure, tell your story… – but on my terms.” You know, it’s very… Yeah. Oh, yeah. 40 minutes right here. Can you believe this doesn’t affect the sound? Can you believe that? This really is… This is engineering. This is… this is why we go to war is to protect this. I want to fight for this. I want to fight for my country with this, okay. Back to the ankle injury. Is your name Rachel? No. Can you imagine that? I would’ve been, “Whoo!” Do you have… a dog. No, I want a dog, though. That’s what I’m picking up on, the urge. Last thing I’ll say or not, it’s my show. Um… Do you have… I’m seeing sisters. Do you have sisters? I have a younger sister. Yeah, so you’re the second sister. So I’m seeing sisters, and it’s you. You have… It’s you and your younger sister. I’m actually an only child. Go ahead, laugh. You’ve got one. Never seen one up close, huh? Go ahead. For those of you who don’t know, an only child is somebody with no brothers, and you guessed it, no sisters. It used to make me sad as a child, but now I realize it’s actually a gift, because I don’t have to live under the crushing weight of the sexual tension that I know exists among all siblings, yeah. That’s what I like when see people full, “Oh, God, the truth!” They’re crossing in. That’s what I like to see. And by the way, that’s okay. You’re normal, okay? Any institution that’s like, “Sex doesn’t exist here,” it’s ’cause it does. And I’ll just say, like if I had a brother, forget about it, okay? Forget… about… it. Cannot imagine. Sneaking a glimpse of him in his boxers at dawn, like… Before school. Heh! Long family car trips, no one else to talk to. Fall in love like that, okay? It’s easy. It’s easy. Getting picked up, being like, “Oh, Josh, put me down! “Stop! “Ugh! You ripped my shirt. Yeah, I need yours. What else am I gonna wear to Easter brunch?” “Mom and Dad aren’t gonna be home for like an hour. “Just give me your shirt. Ugh!” I’m jealous. My, bring up some stuff… And by the way, if you’re uncomfortable, if you feel that, know that that’s for a reason, right? That’s why… that’s why they won’t air this show live. They won’t stream this on the radio right now. And why do you think? ‘Cause people will be driving. “Oh, here’s my light.” They hear my voice. “I have a choice in life?” Veer off the road. A lot’s at risk. Heh! There are cameras, but also… there are cameras. They’re watching. I am always pretty sure I’m being surveilled in bathrooms, ',\n",
       "  'so I will just be like, “I know!” It helps, ’cause I want the person surveilling me to be like, “She sees!” You know, I want… I want to feel that. I want to feel it. I want to feel that. If that… it that’s a crime, then take me back to the bishop’s ranch. Ohh! I want to go back to the bishop’s ranch. Huge theme emerging about the bishop’s ranch. Um… Incredible to feel that, and then touch it with that authentically and to know that’s where I belong. It’s something that I couldn’t have planned, and that’s why I’m so excited to actually present to you, we have the bishop. Come on out! Yeah. In editing, that’ll be… huge. ‘Cause we’re gonna CGI the bishop, and “Oh, my God!” The people at home? “Oh-ho-ho!” Yeah. Sorry. I want money, okay? And people love the bishop. Okay, okay! Wrap it up. Okay. Ohh! I’ll say therapy, get in it now, you know? Is my therapist here? Christina? ‘Cause you never know. Okay, wow. So you’re not curious what I do. Yeah, I was just like, okay, okay. When people say they’re not in therapy, I’m like… you can’t do karaoke forever. You know, you have to… Oh, no. Your friends and family see what karaoke has become for you. So… Uh, sex. Um… I don’t know. I’m not convinced. I’d say. Like, does it even have the power to transform the day? I don’t know. I just… Not to brag, but I probably had the best sex of my life recently, and like an hour and a half later I was furious at Bank of America. Like I don’t… Even the day, you know, couldn’t be changed, so… And I also, I do not appreciate the myth brutally propagated by media that sex is the one time in your life where you’re able to finally shed the prison of your personality. That that’s when your mask finally drops. I find that during sex my mask has never been tighter. Like it’s absolutely… And trust me, I’ve tried to like… You know? You know, I’ve tried, but it’s never so much as slipped. I mean, it’s really… Ugh. I actually think that the only time that we’re truly released from the prison of our personality, the only time that our mask actually drops, is when we barf. I really think that’s it. ‘Cause just the rawness, the animalism, that’s the only time in your life when your… your taste in art, your funny outgoing voicemail, right, your grant money, is irrelevant. It’s not there. It’s just about that. It’s also the only time in modern life when you aren’t being advertised to. That’s it. And trust me, they’ll find a way. Oh, they’ll get in there. They’ll get in your toilet if they have to. Hmm. Oh, I love your laughs. Ohh, I love this moment! Ohh! Really, though, when I hear… I hear kids. I hear little kids going, “Where’s my dad?” Right, I mean… Really, though. Sometimes I’m up here and I’m like, “Where are our dads?” Like, this is crazy. Did you know that you’re born with your eggs? I’ll go back. If you’re… If you’re someone who has eggs, you’re born with them. It’s not like they developed during puberty. Can anyone confirm? This really blew my mind. Yeah. So what does this mean? This means that your mother, the day she was born, you were already inside her. The potential for you was already there. Can you go that far? Yeah. Crying, crying, crying, crying, crying. Okay. So, what I’m trying to say is, we’ve all been marinating in our mother’s rage since the day she was born, and then her mother’s rage, and her mother, her mother, on and on, okay? We’re all stewing in the rage',\n",
       "  ' of all the women who’ve come before us. It’s an intergenerational tajine of rage. And it’s deserved, I want to say that, but it’s been very helpful for me because I’ll be going about my day, everything’s fine, and then out of nowhere I’m like, “I’m gonna break glass,” you know? And I… I’m like, where does that anger come from? It doesn’t feel like it belongs to me, and it’s been very helpful to be like, it’s actually maybe not mine. It’s my grandmother in Spain, like, “Aah!” You know, that’s… That’s who it belongs to. So release. Release thyself. And, you know, honor it, but push through. I actually don’t have kids yet, but my daughter right now is like, “Mom, what are you doing up there? I can feel it.” “Love you, sweetie. Maybe we’ll watch this together one day with Dad.” You probably have read in the news that I’ve been tucking in my blouses more. Sss… And it does feel good. It makes me feel very together. Like I tuck in, and immediately I really do feel like I have children, like I just completely… I feel effective. I’m like, yes, absolutely, right here. I have everything I need. Immediately leaving the house with the blouse tucked in, I’m like there’s all these kids that are like, “Okay, come on. We gotta go. “We gotta go. We’re gonna get in the car. “Can you tell me in the car? Can you tell me in the car? “Okay, great. Yeah?” It’s my husband. “Uh… okay. I could’ve used that information earlier, I’ll be honest, yeah.” “How can I do that now? Uh, I’m just really asking. How can I do that now?” “No, no, I asked you, and… and I remember “’cause I asked you yesterday. “No, I know that you said no, but now you’re saying yes. “Okay, yeah, okay. “Okay, say bye to Daddy. Say bye to Daddy. “Yeah. Oh, hi. Yeah, okay, I’ll call you later. Bye.” That’s the woman who lives next-door who I feel more connected to than my own husband. All of that, all of that with just imagination. Can you believe it? I want you out of your seats. Okay. I have no texts. Not possible, actually. Uh-oh. Remember her? You know what that means. Yeah. We’re in the final quadrant of the show. Isn’t that heartbreaking? Mm. Oh! I’m actually a huge gear nerd, so I usually bring my own mic, ’cause I love to be like… It’s good! We’re set. We’re set. Okay. Life, like this show, is cinnamon in the wind. It’s just… whoosh! You know, it’s gone. And… you’re just there left cursing the air like, “There was spice here once.” You know, it’s… That’s all it is. It’s… It’s hard to admit, but, you know, life is short. I… I like that. Life is short, life is short. Write that down. Okay, we’ll, we’re filming, so that’s fine. “Honey?” Shh, my husband. “Babe… write down ‘Life is short’.” “Life is short. I’m just thinking here. “Uh, live out loud. I like that. Write that down.” Okay. He’s jealous of what I do. Hmm-hmm. Um… yeah, but it’s true that this could really be… Oh, no, not again. Right. No, but this really is me wrapping up formally. Um, people close to me know I hate to leave the stage, so this will not go well, I just want to tell you now. It’s not gonna… it’s not gonna be a smooth one, but we’ll get you… We’ll land you there, okay? We’ll land you in Des Moines. It’s funny. Someone here tonight has the exact laugh of somebody who deceived me, and it’s really… Huh. Now you’re quiet, right? Typical. You do all look gorgeous, though, I have to say. When we started this show, you were all li',\n",
       "  'ke this, “Oh, the mortgage, the mortgage.” Right? And now you’re so relaxed. You’re so open. “The mortgage, the mortgage.” You know? And it is special… Oh, my God… I’m so sorry. Hello? Yeah! I’m at work. Why? Okay. Um… like 30 minutes, yeah. Oh, it’s going really well. Yeah, it’s going well. Ohh, how is she? I said, “Ohh, how is she?” Uh-huh. Oh, she not find it? Shit. Okay. Tell her to look under the bed, yeah. Okay. Okay, okay, great. Um, oh, I gotta go, but, um… okay, perfect. I love you, too. Okay. Bye. Oh, my God. No, I’m sorry. That’s… so rude. First of all, I never wanted to be one of those comedians who took a call onstage. That is crazy, crazy rude, but there’s this guy I’ve been seeing for a while, and he just like told me he loved me, so right now I’m just like, oh, my God. So, I… immediately, the walls. Isn’t that funny? Immediately. “Oh, God, now I can’t trust,” but it’s… I actually… we do have that solid foundation of trust because he is my lawyer, so I feel like there is… we have that, you know? But… hmm! I’m just laughing thinking about how fulfilling my private life is. It’s just crazy. I just… And this is amazing. Like, I love being able to do this and connect like this, but then I go home to my boys, and it’s just very… I have seven sons, um… They are 4, 6, 2, 8, 9, 12, and two days. So I have a lot on my hands. I… Yeah, so I have to go home, but, um… Oh, what… I can’t think about my family for a minute? Okay, sorry, whoa! Okay! No, I’ll get back on schedule for sure. Jesus Christ! In case anyone cares, this whole night has been hell for me. Okay? In case anyone cares! Since the very beginning. Tick tock! Right? “Get to the point, bitch!” Right? I’ve felt that from you, so don’t worry. I’ll be on my way, and you can go back to your perfect life without me. Jesus Christ. By the way, I’ll just say, like, you paid to see me, but I’m the weirdo. Okay, got it! Yeah, all of you staring at me, but I’m the one who has a screw loose. Got it. Sure. Okay. No, I’m being… It’s not cool to, like, yell at you. It’s… I’m, um, sad to leave, because until tonight, I… I didn’t know what a family was. No, I’m serious. I had always seen in… books and… TV movie, things like that. I always saw this family, I always saw these happy people smiling, and I was always banging on the glass like this. “Let me in, let me in!” And I never could get in, and, um… I guess tonight for the first time I actually kind of felt like I was sitting at the dining room table with everyone. So, um, that’s why it’s hard for me to leave, but I have to leave… I have to get back, um… I’m selling tank tops and stuff outside, so… So I have to get back to that, but, um… all good things must end, right? “Write that down, babe! That’s good, but…” But I’m gonna put on a happy face… and we’re gonna get on with the show, right? Because it is a show, and there’s so much pressure on me. And don’t… just… Just don’t forget that tonight. Goodbye. No, okay! Ohh. Ahh. Come on! I have to leave? Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay. I actually have to… I’m slashing material. That’s what I’m doing right now. It’s really hard. I’m slashing. I’m slashing the good stuff. I had this… I did have this incredible closer. It was like… Mmm! You know, it was like really creamy and like brought together all these different little… Little variations on the show. It was like all the different threads of the sho',\n",
       "  'w into this one finely woven tapestry. “Here!” You know? But… time. I just can’t. Heh. Also, closers are gauche. I’m like, “Oh, oh, I’m real… Here’s my big closer.” You know, it’s like… uhh. You know, it’s cheap. It’s cheap! And I don’t want to belittle what we have with material. Like, blah! You know? Are we on a cruise? You know? Jesus. No, I’m… I am like… delaying leaving. There is something I, like, don’t… I’ve been, like, putting off saying. I’m just gonna, like, rip off the Band-Aid and say it. Um… mm! Why is this hard? Oh-kay. My name is not Kate Berlant. And I’m not a comedian. Um… my name is Megan “redacted for my privacy.” Um… but I’m actually the chief research analyst of Behavioral Science at Cornell University, and this has been incredible. I’ve been living as Kate for longer than I’d like to admit, studying the relationship between audience and performer. Things like that, but tonight, uh, it’s over. This was kind of my magnum opus, was to perform as her for an hour. I can’t believe so many people fell for it, but this is my night to sort of shed her, and it’s been… It’s been amazing, but I do want to go back to my roots, my real passion, which is irrigation. And… yeah, just rerouting water systems, the bureaucracy of water, stuff like that, I really want to get into. Uh, so, yeah, I’m gonna shed Kate tonight, and with that… Good night! That’s not it, but can you imagine? No. Not gonna end on that, but, uh… But, yeah, okay. Ohh! The chili sale. The… Okay. I’m selling chili. Uh… I couldn’t send you home with nothing. There is a chili sale happening, um, out front. There are three crocks. They’re Mild, Medium, and “Oh No She Didn’t.” It’s kind of three different… And we encourage you to layer the chilis, right? Have fun with it. They’re 3.99, yeah, uh, a cup. And please, please buy it. Know that all the proceeds go. Um… So… so that’s great. Well, this has been explosive. Your words, not mine. But, um… yeah, it really is time. I have to say when I first got here tonight… I didn’t know what to expect. I was like, Will the spirit be with me, right? Will tonight be a night I just go home, open up the Uber app, and watch the cars go? You know, is that… See, right there I could’ve left. That would have been good. That would have been professional, in fact. Okay, should we do house lights up? I don’t know… Here’s what’s so crazy. Here’s… here’s my dirty secret. The show’s over. No, but it reall… It ended… Yeah, see… By the way, look how casual I am. Is this thing… No, you know. “Where wasn’t I?” That’s the name of the show. But… Yeah, that’s the kind of casual kind of… Oh, my water. Wait, there’s a camera here? Oh, no. Damn it. I wanted to do this, and that, and the other thing. Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Kevin James: Irregardless (2024) In Kevin James: Irregardless, a 2024 stand-up comedy special, Kevin James delivers a performance that expertly blends humor with insightful observations on everyday life. He begins with a quirky musical number, showcasing his singing talent and setting a lighthearted tone. Throughout the special, James touches on a variety of relatable topics, often with a self-deprecating twist. One central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health. James jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of modern life, like being labeled “prediabetic” and the unnecessary fear this instills. He also satirizes societal overcaution with a story about a woman labeled “borderline anemic,” highlighting the tendency to exaggerate health concerns. James humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness, particularly through his mistrust of Siri and the difficulty of deleting apps. His take on modern parenting and child-rearing resonates with many, as he discusses removing video games from his children and the challenges of engaging them in physical activities. This segues into a broader critique of contemporary parenting styles, contrasting them with the stricter, belt-driven discipline of previous generations. In a poignant turn, James reflects on his own limitations in knowledge and conversation, using the story of Buster Douglas to illustrate his narrow expertise. He humorously recounts an awkward social encounter where his lack of knowledge is exposed, leading to a comedic breakdown of his attempt to use complex vocabulary. In his routine, James humorously focuses on the dynamics of his marriage, particularly highlighting the contrast between his wife’s incessant talking and his own introspective nature. He examines their differing communication styles with a blend of admiration and playful frustration. The special concludes with a return to the musical theme, bookending the performance and leaving the audience with a feeling of entertainment mixed with thoughtful reflection on the absurdities of modern life. * * *  ♪ I’ve been having dreams About falling in love ♪ [audience cheering and whistling] ♪ It feels so real ♪ ♪ But nobody is here when I wake up ♪ ♪ Do you know my name ♪ ♪ The devil’s in the detail ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ [audience continues cheering] ♪ I’m a natural born ♪ ♪ Take this hopeless broken soul ♪ ♪ Of this remote control ♪ ♪ Plot twist ♪ ♪ A whole generation lost With no promise ♪ ♪ Can you feel my love ♪ ♪ Do you know my pain ♪ ♪ It’s in my head every night on replay ♪ ♪ A deadly game ♪ ♪ For a natural born killer ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ ♪ Natural born killer ♪ ♪ Okay, game face ♪ ♪ Go time, don’t play ♪ That was for you. That was my gift for you. Yeah. Gonna be honest, gave you a little too much. [audience laughing] I never go that long. That was little longer than I expected. I got a little excited. We’re gonna bring it down. ‘Cause everything hurts. Everything hurts. Last week I woke up, I asked my wife, “Hey.” “Did I play rugby yesterday?” [audience laughing] She’s like, “No, you shook a can of paint for me.” [audience laughing] She was right. This is all I did. This was it. Because it was outside of my every day body movements, I don’t do this. I felt it the day after. I’m gonna feel this tomorrow ’cause I just did this for you guys right now. It wasn’t even a big can. I’m talking the little Häagen-Dazs size. [audience laughing] Body’s falling apart. Falling apart. It’s horrible. When to the doctor to get checked out. He said, “Everything’s really good. I do wanna let you know that you are prediabetic.” I was like, “Hmm, all right?” [scoffs] Who isn’t, right? I mean, come on. [audience laughing] Why would you even tell me that? Do I have diabetes? He goes, “No.” [audience laughing] But I could get diabetes? He goes, “Yes.” Okay. Do you have diabetes? [audience laughing] He goes, “No.” I go, “But could you get diabetes?” [audience laughing] He said, “I guess so.” I go, “Let me tell you something, you’re prediabetic.” [audience laughing and clapping] No charge. That’s on the house. Are you alive? Yeah. You’re also pre-dead. Sorry about that. We’re all gonna die. Pre… Prediabetes. If I have diabetes, tell me. I’ll change the way I eat. What’s with the “pre”? That’s how this world operates. “Pre.” Fear. You might. Almost, you don’t know. Scan. Check. Pre-scan. What? Huh? Yeah. Everything’s fear. Did you hear about Julie? No, what’s the matter with Julie? She’s borderline anemic. [audience laughing] Julie has anemia? No. She’s borderline. She’s close. [audience laughing] So Julie’s anemic? No, she’s not anemic at all. Here’s the line if you would have anemia, you would be on this side of the line. And if you don’t have anemia, you’re on this side with everybody else. Julie is on this side with everybody else. She’s just slightly ahead of us all, closer to the line where she would have it if she did. But she doesn’t. She’s closer. She’s like in the whoa, you better watch out soon area, like maybe. [audience laughing] So, what do you want me to do? There’s nothing you can do. She doesn’t have it. [audience laughing] Then why are you telling me? I just thought you might want a little more anxiety added onto your plate with everything else that’s go',\n",
       "  'ing on the world. [audience laughing] You know, just think about Julie, right? Prayers for Julie, you know what I’m saying? I mean, how does she do it? How does she wake up every day? To face another sunrise, trudging through the day, knowing that she almost has something that she doesn’t even have. [audience laughing] She’s so close to almost having something that, even if she did, it would be that bad. ‘Cause… She could clear it up with some red meat and a little B12. [audience laughing] She, she almost has it, man. [audience clapping] She’s there. She’s in trenches with this. She has two kids. What does she tell them? How do they grow up knowing that they have a mother that’s gonna be fine? [audience laughing] Everything is fear. It’s pre-fear. Fear. You don’t know. Fear. We have nothing to be afraid of. We have nothing to be afraid of. We really don’t. We… Yeah. Yes. [audience whoops] Nothing. We live in the safest times in all of human history. We have nothing to fear. We are so blessed. We are… You know who had something to be afraid of? Men fighting in the Revolutionary War. How about them? Or the Civil War, right? That’s fear. Right? Brother against brother. Across an open field. Chance of survival is minimal. And you’re the guy carrying the flag. [audience laughing] That’s fear. They’re handing out muskets… [audience laughing] …and you get the flag. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’d like a musket, please. Uh, sorry, we’re all out. I can give you the flag. [audience laughing] What do I do with that? Well, you see those line of guys over there, with muskets, across that field? You stand in front of them. You get right in front of them. And you give it a little of this. You just got… [audience laughing] You want me to raise our symbol, show the enemy exactly where to aim? That’s what they did. They didn’t care. They had courage back then. Out in front. Do it. Let’s do it. Get it up there. Yes! Waving that flag. Be aggressive. B-E aggressive. B-E-A-G-R-G-I-G-F-E Aggressive! They didn’t care. [soft popping sounds] [audience laughing] [soft popping sounds] [soft popping sound] Aggressive. [soft popping sound] [soft popping sounds, grunting] I’d be waving that thing so low profile… [audience laughing] They’d be like, “Get that flag up! Let them know who we are!” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I’d be like, “I don’t want the flag. Do you have a bayonet?” “No, I got a snare drum and drum sticks. You want that?” That’s even worse. [imitates drum roll] Fire that thing up! Let them know we’re coming! [imitates drum roll] [audience laughing] Play that thing! I’m playing it, I’m playing it. I’d take out the brushes if I could, right? [imitates brushing a drum] [audience laughing] We have nothing to be afraid of. We, we find things to be afraid of. We do. Food companies know we’re afraid. They know it. That’s why they’re trying to make all their food sound healthy. They market it that way. Have a box of Cheerios. My Cheerios says “may lower cholesterol” on the box. Cheerios may lower cholesterol. You know what I know about Cheerios when it says “may lower cholesterol” on the box? I know that Cheerios doesn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if it did, it would say “Cheerios lowers cholesterol”, but it says “may.” It says “may.” So they, either, honestly, they don’t know, or they had the laziest scientists in the history of the world working down at the Cheerio factory. Where they just come in every day, “Hey, Wendell, how’s it going? Just checking to see where we stand with the whole cholesterol thing.” Can we put that Cheerios lowers cholesterol on the box? Yeah, I wouldn’t. Yeah. I would just stick with “may.” [audience laughing] Just go with “may.” You haven’t figured it out? No, we’re trying to. We’re plugging away, but there’s a lot of stuff going on. I got a phone call earlier. I gotta take my daughter to soccer. There’s things getting involved here, you know. Just go with “may.” Put “may.” “May lower cholesterol.” They’re not gonna know. Put “may.” They’ll think it lowers. You don’t know. I don’t even know. So how are they gonna know? You don’t know that it couldn’t, right? Put that. Cheerios, you don’t know that it couldn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] Put “definitely should lower cholesterol, Cheerios.” [audience laughing] I don’t trust anybody. I don’t trust the food companies. I don’t trust my phone. I don’t trust Siri. Do you trust Siri? Let me tell you, Siri is listening to you every second of the day. [audience laughing] I can’t stand that. You ever download an app? And it starts asking you questions, “Hey, do you mind if I share information with your other apps?” Yes, I mind. How do you even know him? What the hell is going on? [audience laughing] They’re all up to something, those apps. You know it. That’s their goal. They wanna stay on your phone as long as possible. That’s why it’s so hard to delete an app. You ever tried to delete an app? You gotta do that hard press on the phone, first of all. All the apps start shaking. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, they know somebody’s going. They know this. [audience laughing] This is judgement day for one of them. Looking around, seeing what each other did. You know, thinking about who’s going. That’s why they make that little x so s',\n",
       "  'mall. It’s small in the corner. ‘Cause you can’t get it with your fat thumb and you hit anywhere else on the screen and everything settles. And they’re like… [exhales] And then you gotta fire it up again and they’re like, “Oh, my gosh. This guy is relentless.” They’re thinking about what they did. Oh, he’s definitely getting rid of me. It’s not you, it’s me. I haven’t learned Spanish in 30 days. [audience laughing] This idiot couldn’t learn Spanish if he was raised in Guatemala for 30 years. [audience laughing] It’s why it’s so hard dragging an app. You ever tried to drag an app from another page? It’s like, nope. [audience laughing] Nope. I like page five. [audience laughing] I don’t trust doctors. Do you trust doctors? I don’t trust doctors, no. [audience] No! They’re killing people who don’t need to die. I read this one story. This one woman, she was comatose. She was in the hospital. And she came back to life and started breathing again moments after her family pulled the plug. Is that a good story? [audience laughing] Yeah, I mean, she’s living. That’s good. She’s back to life. That’d make for some pretty uncomfortable conversation in that hospital room. [audience laughing] Right after, when she came back. Like, she, whoa! This is amazing! I can’t believe you all were here waiting for me. My family. I love you so much. What have you guys been up to? [audience laughing] Uh, nothing, Mom, nothing. You weren’t, uh, looking so good, Mom. Frankie, unplug your iPhone, you’re at 85%, unplug it. [audience laughing] How’re you feeling, Mom? How you feeling? I feel wonderful. My side hurts a little bit. Yeah, that’s ’cause we’ve already donated all your organs. [audience laughing] They’re coming at three for your eyes. We should get a family photo before they pluck the eyes. Let’s get a family photo. Mom, get in here. Before we’re looking at two black, empty sockets. Let’s go. [audience laughing] Only God pulls the plug on me. I tell my family all the time. Absolutely, yes. I don’t care. He created me. He can take me out whenever He wants. Is it a matter of money? So what? Have a garage sale. [audience laughing] So the kids don’t go to college? Who cares? Let’s be honest, they weren’t going anyway. [audience laughing] Keep the big man breathing. Do whatever you gotta do. I tell them all the time. I don’t care. At some point, there’s gonna be that woman that walks in the room. There’s always… You know what? Kevin would not want to live this way. You falcon-punch that witch right in the throat. [audience laughing] You just grab her and… Stomp her, right there. [audience cheering and clapping] Double strike her. How about you don’t wanna live. Who’s that lady killing people? Just walking in, “He would not wanna go on. He would not wanna do it. There’s no quality of life.” Hi-ya! [audience laughing] I had a close call too, about five years ago. I was, uh, driving home from a show and I hit a deer on the highway. It was pretty scary. It was a horrible experience, wrecked my truck. I was on the side of the road, pretty shaken up. Filling out the police report. She was asking me questions and the officer was like, “What happened? The deer just, uh, jumped out in front of you?” I was like, “What?” [audience laughing] She was like, “Did it just jump out in front of you?” [audience laughing] I was like, “No, no, it waved me over.” Um… [audience laughing] I was barreling down the road about 90 miles and hour and I was like, is that a deer calling over with its hoof? Sure enough, it was. [audience laughing] I pulled over to the side. I was like, “What’s up?” He’s like, “You’re doing like 90.” And I’m like, “Okay, that’s my business. What do you care?” He’s like, “I know you got kids at home.” He knew my kids by name, which freaked me out. I’m like, I’m not gonna talk to this guy anymore. I don’t need this. I’m outta here. He’s like, “Hold up. Hold up. I’m sorry.” He said, “I’m sorry. Let’s started over. We’ll hug it out.” And I’m like, that’s pretty cool, a deer who’s about forgiveness. [audience laughing] I said okay, and go to hug him and he goes to hug me, and he goes, “What’s that?” and he points to my shirt. I go, “What’s what?” I look down, and he did that move in my face… [audience laughing] He goes, “I know where you live.” Then he ran into the woods. I got back in my truck and I started chasing him. But I couldn’t get through the thick trees, so I got out and camped out overnight. [audience laughing] And I waited. The next morning, I saw him. He was talking to a bunch of other deer. I army crawled over to him. And I put blueberries on my face all Rambo style. He didn’t even see me. I jumped on top of him. I sank my hooks in. I slit his throat and he bled out right there on the spot. Then I dragged him, like a mile. [audience laughing] Mile and a half, back to the highway and I threw him on the hood of my truck. [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when you showed up. [audience laughing] So, no, he did not just jump out in front of me. This was premeditated deer murder. [audience laughing] Can’t talk about my kids. I have four kids. Any parents? Lot of parents out there? [audience cheering] Yeah. Yeah. Trying to be a good dad, it’s, uh, it’s tough, man. It’s really hard. These, these times, it’s difficult, you kn',\n",
       "  'ow. I’m really having a tough time trying to motivate my kids. And, I don’t know, like, I don’t know, is it me or is it, like, all parents? I don’t know. Are your kids lethargic? [audience laughing] ‘Cause I got a slug farm at my house. I really… [audience laughing] My kids don’t even get dressed anymore. They just get up from bed with the blanket. They have a blanket on them. They light up their iPad, it illuminates their face, and they just shuffle, shuffle. Like some weird sand creature in a Star Wars movie. Past each other and past me. No one talks anymore. [audience laughing] My son’s the worst, always on the video games. I was like, “Hey, we can’t do this, man. Let’s get some activity, you know.” I went up to him and said, “Hey. Buddy. Listen, let’s, let’s grab a football and, uh, call all your friends. We’ll get on our bikes and we’ll ride over to the field. Grab some cones, we’ll set up outlines and touchdowns and all the stuff. We’ll, we’ll have a great, great game. Awesome game. Maybe two. We’ll wait there till the lights come on in the parking lot. We’ll play a night game as well. We’ll just have a blast. And he just looked over to me and said, “I’m good.” [audience laughing] That was it. My wife goes, “Just take the video games away from him.” That’s a great idea. And I did. We took our video games away from all our kids. All the video games were done. Take them away from your kids. Yes. Yeah, we did it. [audience cheering and clapping] You gotta do it. We have to do it. It helped. It was awesome right away. First of all, the girls, my daughters, their life got so much better immediately. They were seeing friends and reading. They didn’t even care. My son had a tough time. He did. Yeah, he was having… Especially, couple days in, he started getting all shifty-eyed and stuff, looking at me just… [audience laughing] Little shaky leg. He was like an addict. He was really just kinda like… [audience laughing] I could tell he was having a tough time. He was… [audience laughing] [clears throat] Yo. Dad, yo, can I talk to you? Can I talk to your for a second? [audience laughing] Yo. C-Come over here, Brody. Let me talk to you for a second. Get away from Mom for just a second. [audience laughing] You gotta give me something to take the edge off. Give me a little something, a little brain tickler. Give me a little brain tickler. You got some Mario? [audience laughing] I was like, “No. No games, that’s it.” Okay, God bless you, sir. You have a good day. [audience laughing] You have a great day. God bless you, sir. I love you. God bless you. God loves you. You have a good day. Next day he came by, same thing. He’s a little manipulative too. You gotta watch out for him. I don’t know what he was trying to do. He was like, “Hey, how about this, Dad?” [clears throat] What if I got, like, a… an Oculus? I didn’t know what an Oculus is. Do you know? I didn’t even know. I had no idea. It’s the virtual reality, if you don’t know. The goggles. You put these big goggles on your face. And you’re in virtual reality. I was like, “Is it games?” He goes, “Yeah.” I’m like, “No, you can’t have it. That’s it, no games.” He goes, “But you don’t understand. These are active games.” I go, “What do you mean?” He goes, “Oh, it’s unbelievable. They have a boxing game where you can fight like Rocky or like, you know, Apollo Creed or Mohammad Ali. It’s, like, 12 rounds. And you have, like, hand weights. You’re boxing the whole time. You’re sweating like crazy. It’s amazing.” He goes, “There’s a dance cardio game where you’re, like, going crazy. Your heart rate goes through the roof. They also have a warrior game. There’s a warrior game, Dad, you wouldn’t believe it. You’re going through this village just wielding a sword. It’s like a crazy shoulder delt workout the whole time. Everybody’s doing it. All my friends, everybody is just working out like crazy. And here’s the best part, even if it’s raining outside or snowing, doesn’t matter. ‘Cause you get your workout in. It’s awesome.” [audience softly laughing] I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” I started thinking about it. I’d rather you be outside doing stuff, but maybe this is a step in the right direction. So I said, “All right, let’s get the Oculus.” And I got him the Oculus. [audience whooping] Yeah. Wanna tell you how it went down. [audience laughing] First day, he gets the Oculus. I wake up, I go downstairs into the kitchen. He’s already got it on. He’s just standing there in the kitchen. Big, fat goggles on his face, just… [audience laughing] Zero movement. Zero movement. Just standing there. I’m watching him. He doesn’t know I’m there. I walk in. I’m like, “What is this?” This is the Oculus? This is it? And he’s just there. I watch and I’m getting a little upset, but then he starts to move and I go, “Here we go.” He backs up a little bit. I’m like, “Whoa.” He doesn’t even know I’m there. He reaches under. He feels under the kitchen counter. And he gets a stool. [audience laughing] And he sits down. [audience laughing] Now I’m really getting upset. ‘Cause… he doesn’t look like he’s fighting Apollo Creed. [audience laughing] I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt. I don’t know this virtual reality. I don’t know how far it goes back. Maybe his trainer’s stuck in traffic or something. [audience',\n",
       "  ' laughing] But he’s just sitting there now. Just sitting there, for another two minutes. I’m getting upset. I’m about to take them off and he steps up. I go, “Oh, here we go.” He takes one step and levels up. He’s just standing there. I’m like, “Oh. Here we go.” He goes like this. I’m like, “All right.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I go, “Here we go.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I’m like, “Yes, he’s warming up. Look at this.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. [audience laughing] And then he goes back to his perch. He just goes back. [audience laughing] I’m furious. I’m furious. But then he goes like this. He leans like this and then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. He starts going like this. [audience laughing] I’ve no idea what… No idea. Just this. I’ve had enough. I rip the goggles off his head. He’s like, “Oh, no!” Which I’m told you’re not supposed to do. It’s like waking a sleepwalker, you’re not supposed to do that. I put them on. I wanted to see what he was doing. You know what? He was playing a game. You know what game it was? Job Simulator. [audience laughing] He was working part time at a convenience store. [audience cheering and clapping] He was waiting for customers to come in his store. He was just sitting there. [audience laughing] He wasn’t active at all. He wasn’t sweeping up in between customers. Stacking cases of beer in the back. He was sitting there. He was sitting there and then, finally, a customer came in and he stepped up, leveled up, got him a pack of cigarettes or something. Rang him up, I saw the cash register was right there. Gave him the change. Nodded. He’s a polite kid. At least he’s got that going for him. Then he goes back to his chair. And I’m like, “What was this? What was this and all that?” You know what it was? He was scratching off his own lotto tickets. [audience laughing] He’s not even a good fake employee. [audience laughing] I just said, “You’re punished. That’s what it is. That’s what’s up.” I don’t know how to punish our kids anymore. I don’t even know what we can do, what we can’t do. I don’t even know what… I know our parents, our dads, they knew how to punish. Back in the day, they knew how to punish. They did. They had it exactly correct. Every… The punishment always fit the crime perfectly. Because they got the belt, that’s why. [audience laughing] Yes. You only had to get the belt once. You got the belt once, you never did whatever you were doing ever again. Then your dad just had to show you the belt. And that was enough. You remember that? Hey, what did you say? [audience laughing] Yeah, okay, I’m good. Yeah. [audience clapping] Yes. Belt worked. Remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was? You were popping off at your mom, You go like, “Hey. Mom, I’m not having your meatloaf tonight. It’s horrible. I’m not having it. It’s very dry. Who puts peas in meatloaf? I can’t do it. I can’t. It’s way too dry. Look up the recipe, Betty Crocker. Check it out, woman. Why is Dad getting undressed? What’s going on? What are you doing? [audience laughing] “No, add ketchup to it, I don’t care. Some sauce, get it going. It’s just horrible. It’s very dry. What’s up, Dad? Are you a lion tamer? What is this? What’s this snap, snap? Snap, snap. I don’t know… Oh, my God! Oh, God!” [audience laughing] And it worked. The belt’s worked since 25 BC. It’s worked throughout history. All the way up until, like, 1993 when some frail d-bag introduced the first time out. [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when we lost society, right there. When everything burns and civilization comes to an end, we can trace it all the way back to that one guy. That’s the guy. Time out. It changed the game. Time out? How can you do that? Can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day? Hey, Dad, listen up. Very sorry about stealing your car last night, taking it for a joy ride. Doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front, but how’s about this? [audience laughing] Instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in New Orleans… [audience laughing] I’m thinking I’m gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bit. [audience laughing] Maybe think about where I went wrong, maybe not. I don’t even know. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I might sing a song, I might hum one. It doesn’t matter. Important thing is, it’s my time, it’s my time over in that corner. And when I feel good enough, and I feel like I’m ready to inject myself back into society, I will come back here and I will tell you and we’ll see how that goes. How do you feel about that, cowboy? How’s that? [audience cheering and clapping] Why are you getting undressed again? What’s going on? [audience laughing] Time out. They don’t even do time outs anymore. Now time outs are too cruel. They’ve become too cruel. Time outs. Oh, the ch… No, you can’t. What? You can’t do a time out. It’s too cruel for the child. They’re alone. They’re isolated. They’re in the corner of the room. By themselves. There are other people. They’re just… No, they’re way… It’s in a corner. They’re looking at two walls meeting. It’s, it’s too much for the child to deal with. You',\n",
       "  ' can’t isolate them like that. Any… You can’t. You just can’t isolate them. They don’t even do that anymore. They don’t do time outs anymore ’cause it’s too much. They do what’s called a time in. It’s called a time in. I’m serious. What they do is the dad will take the child, you sit in the middle of the room, they put the child next to them, they stroke their shoulder and… You both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where… the child went off the tracks. And… Once you start making them feel good about being bad… [audience laughing] Probably after, like, seven or eight minutes, you just let them go. Then you stay there for, like, an additional four minutes. [audience laughing] Just to think about what a loser of a parent you’ve become. [audience cheering and clapping] We’re raising baby veal. That’s what we’re doing. We are. We are. We are. We’re so easy on our kids. And so what? It doesn’t help them. I love my kids. We all love our kids. We know that. But you know what? They all can’t be the best. They can’t. Not right away, anyway. This is what we tell them, constantly. You’re the best. You are the best. You are so good. You are the best. You’re the best. Isn’t he the best? Yeah. He’s the best. You’re the best. He’s the best. You’re so good. You’re the best. [loud sigh] No, you suck. [audience laughing] You’re not… What are you the best at? We wanna get you to be the best, but you can’t do anything right now. What can you do? Can you match your socks? Can you do a back flip? Can you black tar a driveway? Can you roll a cigar? Can you drive a forklift? Can you put your toothbrush back in the cup when you’re done using it? [audience laughing and clapping] Nothing. Without me, you can do nothing. If I dropped you off in the woods you wouldn’t last ten minutes before you were eaten by coyotes. [audience laughing] Kids suck. They suck. [audience laughing] They’re not good. They’re not good. That should, that’s the definition of a kid. “You suck.” That’s what they should be called. How many you-sucks do you have? I’ve got one and two on the way. [audience laughing] Twin you-sucks? That’s amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. [audience laughing] Your kids suck. My kids suck. I’m sorry to break it to you. There’s one kid I saw on the internet. One kid. This four-year-old Korean boy. He was playing Mozart on an accordion. He had something special, nobody else. [audience laughing] But 100% he got the belt. Oh, he definitely got the belt. Oh, he was Mozarting his ass off. He was like… [audience laughing] That’s how you get good. [audience laughing] My son wanted to play Little League. So I called the coach. I said, “Listen, my boy wants to play. Is it okay if he joins the team?” He’s like, “Yeah, we didn’t even start practicing yet. We practice Thursday night.” I said, “That’s wonderful. It’s awesome. And, uh, I’ll bring him down.” He says, “Yeah, I just wanna let you know that we don’t keep score in this league.” [audience laughing softly] I say, “Why? Why not?” He’s like, “We don’t wanna upset… the parents and disappoint any of the kids, so we don’t keep score.” I was like, “Why even have them bat?” Why not just have them walk up to the plate, “Hi, how’re you doing?” [audience laughing] Could you put me down for a double? [audience laughing] Yeah, my mother says I preregistered for a double. I got a double. Thank you. I got a double, Mother! [audience laughing] A double. I got a double. Every kid gets a trophy. You know how I found out? There was a $40 charge on my bill. I was like… [audience laughing] What’s this right here? He like, “That’s for trophies.” We didn’t even have a practice yet. He’s like, “Congratulations, you guys won. You guys are champions.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “Who?” He’s like, “Everyone.” Everyone? Me? He goes, “Yeah. Did you drive him here?” I go, “Yes.” He goes, “Congratulations, you’re a winner.” [audience laughing] I played Little League in the 1970s. Played for five years. Got a trophy once. One year. That’s it. One trophy. You know why? ‘Cause we won. That’s it. [audience cheering and clapping] You know how I know? ‘Cause we kept score. [audience laughing] You know why we did that? ‘Cause that’s how baseball’s played. The team with the larger number, the more runs, they’re the winners. And the losers are the team with the less numbers. They’re the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better. And sometimes that drive actually helps them. That’s actually the better choice, to lose and try to come back, because it’s human nature. Human nature. [audience cheering] It’s good for them. One trophy. That’s all I had. I would go in my room and see that one trophy. I’d be like, “Oh, yeah. That’s the year we won.” That’s it. The one time. That was worth it. It was great. I went to my neighbor’s house. His living room is littered with trophies. I know his kids. I’m like, “This is criminal.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “What’s this one for?” Oh, that’s when Warren was gonna try out for photography club. [audience laughing] But he got a cold and missed the season. It says “MVP.” Yes, we’re very proud of him. [audience laughing softly] They’re so fortunate, kids today. They have the greatest fields, I see them, I see them here. The pristine sod and the outfield walls. With the spons',\n",
       "  'ors and the, and the lights for night games. Kidding me? I played in the 70s and they had none of that. You pull up to, like, a parking lot with cement and clumps of grass and broken Schmidt’s bottles everywhere. Just… Is this field two? Yeah, this is field two. This is us. Your coach would pull up in a 1971 Impala, pop the trunk to hand out uniforms. [imitates trunk squeaking open] Had everything in that trunk. Clearly thrown out of his house ten minutes ago by his wife. [audience laughing] Smoking right in front of us. [audience laughing] Gather round, guys, gather round, team. Get around me. Make a circle. Listen to me, if it’s a hit to right field… shortstop got it covered. Second base… don’t overthrow the cutoff man, okay. You’re overthrowing the… Like a nicotine oscillating fan right in our faces. [audience laughing] No parents running over, “Hey, Phil, maybe you shouldn’t smoke in front of the kids.” You kidding me? They’re setting up snack tables, playing dominoes, drinking vodka, about 30 yards that way. [audience cheering and clapping] They’re just so happy the weird guy in the polyester pants and bushy mustache is looking after them for a while. Right in my face. Benson and Hedges. It stung right in the retinas. Stinging me like crazy. Smoke billowing down my body. But you know what? No allergies today. [audience cheering and clapping] Nada. I eat whatever I want. I can see a raccoon walking around midday. Just rip it’s face off, clumps of hair missing, doesn’t matter. I can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later. [audience laughing] You know why? ‘Cause I drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard. [audience cheering and clapping] That sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time, melting that plastic. It boiled up so much it would burn your face. It wouldn’t even come out in a steady stream. You’d be p-p-p-p-p… [audience laughing] Firing rusty spickets through that thing like BBs into the back of your throat until it wasn’t enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that. [audience laughing] Just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house. Just… [audience laughing] Go right to the source and I was fine. Why was I fine? ‘Cause all day long at school I’m chewing on pencils. [audience laughing] I’m sniffing magic markers like they’re going out of style. Thirty seconds a nostril. Have some fun. Get used to it. Eating paste ’cause it looked like mayonnaise. [audience laughing] Or Play-Doh. How good did Play-Doh smell? Smelled amazing. You try it, like, whoa, different story. [audience laughing] Next day, you try it again. Different color. You’re like, “Maybe this is fruit flavored. Try.” [audience laughing softly] We had allergies and things back in the day. We just didn’t label everything. I’m sure I had anxiety. I know I did. I was a pitcher. I was eight years old. I remember this. I had a really strong arm. I was on the mound. I was firing the ball, aiming it, and I was missing the plate. I started walking batters and it was getting to me. I loaded up the bases and I was breathing heavy. I felt it. I felt this heaviness. And it was bothering me. I started trying harder and I was walking more batters. I started walking runs in. I’m looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and I felt terrible. I remember this. ‘Cause I remember my dad, who was also a coach, he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. He literally walked up to the mound, he put both hands on my shoulder, looked me dead in the eyes and says, “Hey. Stop aiming the ball. You know what to do.” He said two words. “Just throw.” That’s all he said. “Just throw.” He turned around and he walked back to the dugout. And I remember it’s the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. Think about it. Anytime life has got you down, there are obstacles you gotta overcome. Just throw. That’s all you gotta do. Just throw. Yes. Believe in yourself. [audience cheering and clapping] Trust yourself. And just throw. And that’s what I did. I launched back into my windup and I just threw. And I shattered the kid’s cheekbone. I remember… [audience laughing and clapping] Ball bounced like 30 yards, two more runs scored. So my Dad was wrong there. You gotta aim the ball. [audience laughing] In baseball. That’s the… That’s like where… That’s the worst advice ever. To just, just throw it in baseball. Then you’re just running around, just throwing at everything. You can’t. You gotta… [audience laughing] Doesn’t work in baseball. But anywhere else in life, it’s great advice. Great advise. Just throw. Just do it. He was smart. My dad was a smart man. Never went to college. Didn’t have to. Didn’t know all subjects, but he knew subjects in depth. He had depth to the subject. That was it. He knew it. He knew it well. I don’t have that. I don’t know, my Dad was handing me the, uh, knowledge baton. He was literally like, “Here it is. From generation to generation. This is all the wisdom and intelligence of our family. And I’m giving it to you, my son.” And I was like… I’m good. [audience laughing] I don’t feel like reading that thing right now. I paid for it. ‘Cause he could answer any question I ever had. And I k',\n",
       "  'now nothing now. As an adult, I’m faking it. That’s why I hate having conversations. ‘Cause I don’t know enough. I know things, but I don’t have any in-depth knowledge. I can’t go deep. Still water does not go deep. That’s why, anybody talks to me, it’s literally like they say something and I have zero point of view. I can’t add anything to it. I’m just like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. [audience laughing] One subject, one subject I know a lot about. Buster Douglas. Remember him? Remember the heavy-weight champ who upset Mike Tyson back in 1990? At the Tokyo Dome. Forty-two to one odds. Mike Tyson was 37-and-0 at the time. 55,000 people there. I know all this. You know why I know it? Because ESPN had a 30 for 30 on it and I recorded it and watched it, like, 12 times. So I have all this information about Buster Douglas. Here’s the thing. Hardly ever comes up in conversation. [audience laughing] That’s how dumb I was. I put all my eggs in the Buster Douglas basket. [audience laughing] And my wife, this was the worst. We got invited to this local municipal government fundraising dinner. It was, like, every word I hated in there. Except dinner. I was fine with that. [audience laughing] Hope you said no. She was like, “I accepted.” Why would you do that? I don’t wanna talk to anybody. I can’t. I don’t know anything about government. They’re gonna make me look like an idiot. I don’t wanna do it. She’s like, “Relax.” She’s good at talking. She’s like, “I’ll go with you. I’ll be there the whole time. I promise you, we’ll mingle around, we’ll have some hors d’oeuvres, we’ll have a little dinner, and then we’ll leave. And I’ll stay with you the whole time.” You promise? She’s like, “Yes.” As soon as we get there she goes, “I’ll be right back. I have to go the bathroom.” And she takes off. [audience laughing] Some guy walks over to me. He says, “Hey.” I’m like, “Oh, gosh, here we go. Hey!” How about this whole Figueroa thing as councilman? Tell you one thing, he ain’t gonna last, huh? [audience laughing] Let’s break it down, shall we? First, don’t know who Figueroa is. Don’t know… You know what a councilman is? Do have any idea? He could’ve said carrot-maker. It wouldn’t have made a difference. I’ve no idea what a councilman is. [audience laughing] How do I answer? I wanna look like I know, so I go, “Really?” Like I’m concerned for Figueroa. He goes, “Yeah, really.” I go, “Why?” He goes, “I’ll give you one reason why. Treason.” I was like, “Treason? You gotta be kidding me.” In my head, I’m going, you don’t even know what treason means. [audience laughing] You don’t know the definition of treason. I don’t know… Did you ever break away from a conversation mentally to try to figure out a word that somebody just launched at you? You’re in your head, going, break it down. Treason. What does it mean? Treason. Well, tree is in the front, reason is in the back. Trees… are reasonable. Maybe he’s talking about the environment. Get in there and talk about the environment. So I go back to talk to him and he’s just staring at me. So I don’t know how long I was out for, you know. I don’t know if he asked me a question or not. He’s just staring at me. I’m starting to sweat, ’cause I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling uncomfortable. And he doesn’t say… So I go to my fallback, which is this. It’s great. I just go, “Yeah, it’s all crazy anyway. What are you gonna do, right? He’s supposed to say, “Yeah, it’s nuts. Anyway, you have a good night.” You too. But he doesn’t. He goes, “What’s crazy?” I go, “I don’t know. No one’s ever answered my question with a question before.” [audience laughing] Just the whole thing. He’s like, “What whole thing?” How it all went down. He’s like, “What went down?” Motherf… Just leave me alone! [audience laughing] He was trying to expose my stupidity. He wouldn’t stop. He was not letting me go. He was chasing me, like I was an opossum running behind a dumpster and he had a flashlight in my face. What did you say? No, you’re dumb. What did you say? You’re very dumb. You don’t know who Figueroa is. Who is Figueroa? No, you don’t. Who is Figueroa? Who is Figueroa? Who is he? You don’t… Name the three branches of government. [audience laughing] I’ll spot you Legislative. [audience cheering and clapping] I should just be honest with people. I should just walk up, “Hi, my name’s Kevin. I got about a fourth grade vocabulary.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna get lost pretty quickly into the conversation, but I’ll stay here and I’ll nod my head and I’ll smile, make you feel better about yourself, but don’t be fooled, I am dead behind the eyes. [audience laughing and clapping] I don’t do that. I try to match. I try to match. I throw in big words I don’t even know. What do you think the problem with society is? I go, “I gotta be honest. I harken…” Har… Harken. [audience laughing] I’ve never said “harken” before in my life. Harken? What am I? Winston Churchill? Where… It behooves me to think that… my monocle and my, mm, pocket watch, ha-ha, burlap brown pants, working on the cobble stone in London, fatty, fatty, fatty pants. Fatty pants. Walking in London rain. Who am I? Mm, pipe. Who am I? Harken. Or I answer too quickly. What do you think the problem with the culture is? I’m like, “I know what it is.” I know what it is? [audience laughing] I go, “',\n",
       "  'I think it’s a lack of conscious.” Conte-ness. Consci-ness. He’s like, “What?” You ever not even be sure of the tense of a word? C… It’s a lack of con… conscience-ness. [audience laughing] I’m sorry, what did you say? C-Con… It’s a lack of consciention… [audience laughing] It’s a lack of con… uncon… I think unconscien… unconscientuously. I think uncon… con… Conscience… Conchi… It’s a lack of conch… Of we’re not uncontentience. [audience laughing] You’re gonna have a society… S-so… So-socotal… Socielitally… You’re gonna get a tyranny. A tyr… A tyran… An tyrannical-saurus rex is gonna come back. [audience laughing] And the dinosaurs are here. That’s what I’m saying. I’m sorry, I’m not following you. I went… [scoffs] Irregardless of that, I gotta tell you… I said it. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, he stopped me, “That’s not even a word.” I beg to differ. He’s like, “I’m sorry, you’re not making any sense.” [audience laughing softly] You know what else didn’t make sense? When Buster Douglas upset Mike Tyson back in 1990. [audience cheering and clapping] At the Tokyo Dome. 55,000 people. Forty-two to one odds. You have a good night, sir. Have a good night, sir. [audience clapping] That’s when my wife walked out of the bathroom. What did I miss? Anything good? Ha-ha. Okay. All right. My wife’s awesome. I love her so much. She… We’re an amazing fit because she loves to talk. She’s like the balance to me. She’s so good at it. She can talk to people. She knows what questions to ask. She just loves it. I remember, that night we got in the car to drive home. She just started talking again. I was like, “Hey. You know, we don’t need it now. We…” [audience laughing] We don’t need to talk ever again. [audience laughing] We don’t. That’s a good thing. We’ve been together, like, 20 years. I’ve already said every word I’m ever gonna say to her in every combination. That’s it. And she said every word to me. She knows everything about me. I know everything about her. We don’t need to talk anymore. We can finish out the rest of our life with gestures. That’s it. [audience laughing] Not her. She loves to talk. She loves it. She’s just one of those people. She just loves it. Loves the sound of her internal voice. She’s like, “Uh…” Loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something. The whole nine yards. Whatever’s involved with talking, she… [makes noises] Ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice? They’re ma-ma-ma-ma. Brr… Brr… Brr… La-la. Brr… She just goes. I don’t think she’s ever had an unexpressed thought in her life. [audience laughing] No. Everything she sees, it goes right in, and she has to say it. She just, “Oh, my gosh, this door’s so squeaky. That picture’s crooked, I can’t believe that. We’re gonna make eggplant for Thursday. We’ll have some friends over. Would that be good? Look at my reflection in the mirror. I see two of me. Do you see two of me? It’s really weird. I can’t believe the kids are standing on hardwood floor now, look at that. The lights are good. The holidays are coming. This is fun.” Hey, sit one out. Sit one out. [audience laughing] I have thoughts in my head all day long. Weird ones. How many tater tots can I fit in my mouth without dropping any? [audience laughing] It’s in there, but I keep it in the barn. I keep it in there. Not my wife. She doesn’t have any barn doors. It’s just free-range thoughts. I see it. I say it. I see it in the senses and I say it. Look at those exit signs. The light. The floor. Everything is… I see it. I say it. I see it. I say it. It’s like a verbal wood chipper. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] I see it. I say it. I gotta say it when I see it. I see it. I say it. I gotta say it. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] Hey. There’s an ebb and flow to conversations. There is. Fifty percent is listening. It’s like double Dutch. You gotta wait for your turn. [audience laughing] Not her. She’s in there the whole time. Like… I got this. This is my talk. This is my talk. Back it off. Can someone else talk? Get outta here, [unclear], this is me. Big Mac, Fillet-o-Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries, I see Coke, milkshake, sundaes, and apple pie. [audience cheering and clapping] You wanna talk? Talk. Go in your closet, take your clothes off, and talk all night long. But why do I have to be there? [audience laughing] It’s this emotional backboard. She doesn’t care what I think or say. She wants me there. Why? Talk. Go. I always gotta be there, though. I’m literally brushing my teeth. Getting ready for bed. And I hear it. [audience laughing] Telling me things. That I experienced with her. I was with her all day. [audience laughing] Can’t believe Alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son. I didn’t like that at all. I couldn’t believe it. Could you believe it? In my head, I’m going, “Yes, I can. You know why? ‘Cause I was there.” [audience laughing] This was your point of view. [audience laughing] This was mine. I was there. I experienced everything with you! Na-na-na-na-na… Talking herself to sleep. Literally talking herself through sleep. You know how much you wanna go to sleep and you’re tired? And she’s still fighting it. [mumbling] [exhale, mumbling] [mumbling] Finally. It goes quiet. Sweet quiet. You go to bed. Next morning I wake up',\n",
       "  '. [audience laughing softly] I’m brushing my teeth. And it starts up again in the other room. [audience laughing] I’m like, “What new knowledge did you pick up…” [audience laughing] “…overnight?” What did you get? What could you have picked up? Nothing new happened. [audience laughing softly] But she wants me there. She wants me in that conversation. Again, doesn’t care about what I have to say. Does… doesn’t matter. She wants me there. And she tries to get me snagged into these conversations. She’ll like lob out half sentences to me. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me. [loud sigh] I sure hope Ellen’s gonna be okay. [audience laughing] I usually let the first one just pass by. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if enough time passes, I can just kinda… [mumbles] [audience laughing] But there’s always a follow-up. Sure hope they can work through this. Okay, we gotta engage. [audience laughing] I’m thinking, “What’s our plan?” Our plan is, we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible. We have so much stuff to do. But we can’t try to shorten the conversation. We know that, ’cause she’ll sense that. She’s good at that. And then she’ll tack on 45 minutes just out of spite, so… [audience laughing softly] What if I steer into it? What if I go in the other way? It’s dangerous, but it’s… Risky move, but it could pay off. Let’s just go into it and I did it. Hey, honey. Yeah. Let’s do it. Let’s do what? Let’s just talk about Helen all morning long. [audience laughing] Let’s just do it. We’ll grab a couple of beanbag chairs. Put on a pot of coffee. We’ll sit down. You tell me everything about Helen from conception to this morning. [audience laughing] Let’s do it. Let’s just get knee-deep in Helen. What do you say? Okay, first of all, it’s Ellen. It’s not Helen. There’s no H, okay? [audience laughing] She’s my friend from Pilates who you don’t know. She’s going through some stuff right now. But let’s do it. Let’s just do it anyway. I don’t care. I wanna learn about her. And I wanna be here to learn about her, with you. What do you say? [loud exhale] [audience laughing] No. I promised her I wouldn’t say anything to anybody. [audience laughing] Okay. I really wanted to be here for you. I love you. I just wanted to let you know that. I’ll see you later, okay. [audience cheering and clapping] There’s always a follow-up. All right, I’ll tell you. But you gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody else. Promise you? I can’t do that. What if I’m playing softball with the guys? And we’re warming up and I’m throwing with my buddy and he’s like, “Hey, anything going on with your wife’s friends at Pilates that I should know about?” [audience laughing] I can’t believe you brought that up. Yes. Guys, bring it in. Everybody, bring it in, both teams. Come out of the dugout. Everybody, take a knee. I wanna tell you about my wife’s friend Ellen or Helen, who I don’t know, from Pilates. [audience laughing] She’s going through some stuff right now. No, hands down, I’ll answer questions afterwards. [audience laughing] You gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody. How about I promise you I’m not listening to a word you’re saying as you’re saying it? How about none of your words are actually reaching my ears? Nothing. Nothing. They’re exploding in the atmosphere before they reach me like a fourth of July party, like… [soft popping sounds] I can’t believe… [popping sounds] I can’t believe she named… [popping sounds] And I told her her coworkers… [popping sounds] I’m getting none of this. [popping sounds] I’m getting none of it. [popping sounds] I didn’t even know you were taking Pilates. [popping sounds] [audience laughing] Just gotta beat her at her own game. That’s all you gotta do. Fourteen. What? Fourteen. What? That’s how many tater tots I think I can fit my mouth without dropping any. You guys are the greatest!

[audience cheering] [upbeat music playing] [cheering continues] [mouthing] Thank you. [cheering continues] Thank y’all. I caught it. Thank y’all so much. Thank y’all so much for coming out to watch me. Lexington, Kentucky, thank y’all. [audience cheering] Thank y’all. If I could get out there, and straddle every one of y’all, and kiss y’all on the mouth, I would. [audience laughing] Okay. I’ve got on a girdle. [audience laughing] From here to here. And I can feel fat coming out of the back. [audience laughing] I want y’all to know that I was so cute in the ’80s. I really was, all right? I’m 57 years old and I… I’ve gained weight. And I’m really trying to do better. But that old, mean, stupid COVID. I wanna blame the mean, stupid COVID, and Vladimir Putin. [audience laughing and cheering] But I can’t. I can’t. It wasn’t all their fault. But the pandemic did do a number on me. You know, I really thought I could cope in a crisis effectively. And I don’t… [chuckling] I don’t think I can. I had big ideas about hiking, and jogging, and doing, and I didn’t. All right, do y’all remember when it first happened, and they said, “Give us two weeks. Give us two weeks.” Okay. I went, “Whoo! I’ll make a chicken pot pie.” [audience laughing] I made a chicken pot pie, and then that darn thing dragged on and on. And I made more chicken pot pie. And then I mixed alcohol with it. [audience laughing] And then I got on a big Jell-O kick. Well, I was taking care of my little mom and daddy. I couldn’t tour, so I would go and spend the night with my little mom and daddy who are 79 and 81. And I don’t know if y’all saw videos about me taking care of them during the… [audience cheering] Well, I want y’all to know, they’re doing great. They’re doing great. But I would go and stay with them, and they would have the thermostat on 82. And we watched, uh, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, and then we would go to bed at 6:00. And my little mama had to have soft foods there for a while, so that’s why I got on that Jell-O kick, even though my people, we make Jell-O salads for everything where I’m from. We do. We love it for a church supper. We love it to give it to somebody when they’re sick. We love it to give to somebody when they’re breastfeeding. [audience laughing] Because it’s refreshing. But I did not know how much sugar was in that Jell-O when I was sitting there eating it. And I sat there and ate all that with my little mama, and then all of the sudden, my stomach was laying on my legs. [audience laughing] Look at all these good-looking men. Lord. I did not know all of y’all were coming. I wouldn’t have been talking about my stomach on my legs. Look at y’all in these half-zip golf pullovers. Hello! That says “health insurance” to me. [audience laughing] All right, y’all make me think of my husband. Let me tell you about him. Uh, ’cause he’s got a 401(k), and… [audience laughing] Yeah! Okay, we met at the University of Tennessee. [scattered whooping] When I hear a man say “Go Vols,” I think, “Oh my Lord, did I make out with him in the ’80s?” [audience laughing] [laughing continues] I did horrible things in the ’80s. But my husband and I met, and I was so cute, and I was little. I had on little britches and my thyroid was functioning. And I felt good. And he was so enthralled with me, and so in love with me, and pursued me, and bought me presents, and vacuumed out my car, and did all kinds of things for me. And we celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary this year. [audience cheering] Thank y’all. Thank y’all. And, now, I truly believe he would not pull me out of a burning vehicle. [audience laughing] [laughing continues] All right, let me tell y’all about him. So, my husband is a very Type A, anal-retentive overachiever. And everything has had to be perfect all of his life. And he has made perfect grades, and he’s done everything perfect, and everything right. And he’s very competitive. He will rip your throat out. [audience laughing] We’ve tried to play cards socially with other couples, and I don’t listen and pay attention, and play a funky card, and then he cusses me. And then… [audience laughing] And I’m like, “I was just gonna drink a Diet Coke in fellowship.” “That’s what I’m doing.” He ran the Burger King when he was 15 years old in Morristown, Tennessee. The',\n",
       "  'y gave him a key. He played football on Friday night, and then would get up, and make biscuits starting at 4:00 in the morning at the Burger King. Honey, that’s how anal-retentive. And so then what did he do? He married me. [audience laughing] And I am an underachiever. And I haven’t done much right, and, um… But I’m fun. [audience cheering] He is very introverted, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But I did not know how truly blank he was until all these children… three children grew up and walked off and left me with him. [audience laughing] He does not chat. He does not chat. And he’s got a big job. He’s got a big job, and he has to talk all day, and be in meetings, and on the phone. And, you know, men only have so many words they use in a day. That… That is science. My husband uses all his words up during the day at work, and then comes home at night and stares into space. And I need people. I need people. I just stand in the kitchen and talk to myself. [audience laughing] He works for a large manufactured housing company, the largest in the United States, and he’s worked for them for over 25 years. And he’s traveled with them Monday through Thursday or Tuesday through Friday. And that has worked for us. It really has. Me and these kids had a ball without him. [audience laughing] He’d come on the weekends, come home and really put a kink in things, but… [audience laughing] So, during this whole pandemic, he could not travel. I know. He had to make an office in our home. And he would come out every morning and give me this huge list of things that he thought I should be doing. [audience chuckling] Hard things! Hard things. Things like “paint the hallway” or something like that. I said, “Excuse me, but I stay in my gown until the third hour of The Today Show.” [audience laughing loudly] I said, “You don’t know me, do you?” [audience laughing] He would come in at lunchtime in the kitchen and not make eye contact with me. And come and stand next to me and grab one of my breasts. [audience laughing] And hold it. [audience laughing] [laughing continues] [laughing continues] And he’d say, “What’s for lunch?” [audience laughing] And I’d say, “Chicken salad?” [audience laughing] Now, I love him. I love him, I just don’t wanna be with him. [audience laughing] You know. No. He has been a wonderful provider. Wonderful provider. And he’s worked like a dog for us, and done without so that we could have. But all that money going out and taking care of a family all those years, that’s hard on a man. It’s hard on a man. It’s made him a real butthole. [audience laughing] I love him. Lord, I don’t want anything to happen. I don’t want him to run off with a mobile home woman. [audience laughing] I’ve got a good friend that has been through a divorce, and I’ve watched her go through this, and she’s really doing well. She’s doing great. She’s quit eating bread. And… [audience laughing] She’s doing sit-ups in the living room, and she looks like a movie star. And she wants a man. She’s ready to get out there and get another man. And it is on like Donkey Kong. [audience laughing] I’ve watched her go through this and I thought, “Oh my Lord, if I had to get out here and get a man at 57… after I’ve eaten all this Jell-O…” [audience laughing] Yes. It would take $1,000 just to groom… what all I’ve got going on. [audience laughing] I’ve got a toenail that doesn’t look right. We’ve got a girlfriend in our friend group, and she’s 58, and she loves her husband, loves him. But we were saying, “Lord, if we had to get out here and get a man.” She said, “Okay, I think I could show somebody my left breast.” [audience laughing] She said, “It still looks okay.” I thought, “Where is my friend gonna go on dates?” Where do people go on dates in their fifties and sixties? Lord. I have not dated since the ’80s. Honey, I was like… I want y’all to know that I can dance. I am coordinated and I’m athletic. I really am. I can bust a move. I’m not good at math. I can’t do math. But I can bust a move. But if I had to go to a club… This is how I’d dance now if I had to go to a club. ‘Cause I don’t want to jiggle. And I could see a man going, “What’s that?” And me going, “Nothing, that’s just a precancer.” [audience laughing] My friend is on dating apps, and she said everybody on the dating apps looks like they work at Buc-ee’s. [audience laughing] She said, “Everybody’s got a big cowboy hat on, and they’ve got their shirt unbuttoned down to their bellybutton.” But I thought, “What is she gonna do after a date?” Is she gonna go home with a man and make out around his CPAP machine? [audience laughing] Everybody I know is on a CPAP machine. I’ve wondered, “Should I get on a CPAP machine?” All right, you dolls, let me look at y’all. All right. Most of y’all probably are in my stage of life. [audience cheering] [cheering continues] Y’all take supplements. I bet we’re all on a good probiotic. I hope so. But then I look and I see some younger mamas in here. I see some younger girls. If you’ve got little children, can you clap for me or are you too tired? [scattered clapping] [audience laughing] Pretty tired. You sound pretty tired. Well, Lord, you’ve got a lot on you. And, um, you know you’re have to go home and do… nasty things to pay for these tickets. [audience laughing] I just wanna say thank y’all for coming out. Y’all probably ',\n",
       "  'don’t get to go anywhere most of the time. I know, my darling. I wish I could go home with y’all and put in a load of wash… and help y’all, but… When I see darling, young mamas like this, my heart goes out to them, because I remember it, but I don’t… Now, I’ve gotten far removed from it, but I remember how stressful it was. It was a wonderful time in my life to get to be with my little children, but it was stressful. And see, now, I’m not responsible for anybody. I lay up in the bed and watch Netflix. I can lay up in the bed and binge-watch Better Call Saul. You know? Nobody needs me. But I remember being young and my husband was always traveling, making a living for us. And I would be at home, and there would be a crisis happen, like a raccoon would get caught in a trash can. You know? Something… And I’d have to take care of it on my own, and I’m not good at stuff like that. I’m sissy. I don’t even know how to mow. [audience laughing] But I also remember, especially my boy, so smart and sweet but forgetful, and he would say to me almost every week, “Oh, I’ve got a project due.” I go, “When?” “In the morning.” [audience laughing] It’d be nine o’clock at night, I’d go, “Oh my Lord.” He’d go, “It’s not bad. It’s not bad.” “I’ve just gotta build a replica…” [audience laughing] “…of an early 1900s tenement house…” [audience laughing] “…in Brooklyn, New York.” [mouthing] “I just need 300 popsicle sticks and a… and a can of brown paint.” And I’d have to get in the car with no bra on, with three little children, and go to Walmart in the middle of the night. But I want y’all to know what your future is gonna be. And I… [audience laughing] Not in a bad way, I’m just trying to be informative. Don’t eat white flour and sugar. Okay, that’s one thing. But I wish somebody told me what I was gonna… what was headed in my way. I think I could’ve dealt with it better. Okay, there’s a thing that’s gonna happen to y’all in your late thirties, early forties. It can start then. And it comes in the middle of the night like a ghost. And it’s called perimenopause. And nobody talks about it. And they should because it lasts ten years. And these boys that are my age, they’ve already been through this. Honey, they’ve laid in the bed next to a woman and thought, “Is that steam coming off of her?” [audience laughing] “Why is she crying because Tanya didn’t invite her to the Weight Watchers meeting?” Her hormones are just like this. Y’all’s hormones will be similar to a middle school girl. Do you remember that horror? Okay, that’s perimenopause. You’ll know you’re in it when all of the sudden, you’ll start sweating here and here at night, and you’ll wake up, and your hair will look like chicken fuzz. And there’s nothing you can do about it. I have to do all this stuff to my hair now. I didn’t do a thing to my hair for 25 years. I didn’t do anything. The only time I’ve spent this much time on my hair was the ’80s. [audience laughing] I’m from a town of 500 people in Middle Tennessee, outside of Nashville, on the Kentucky-Tennesse border. It’s a farming community where we grow dark-fired tobacco, and my people are farmers on both sides, generations back. And I went to this precious little school that was kindergarten through twelve, 650 students. I graduated with 42 people, and they were all darling and my best friends. And the big percentage of them were gonna get married right out of high school and start farming, and I wanted to too. I had a high school boyfriend, and I loved him. And he was from farming people and went to the big-city high school. And, uh, I look back on it, and… He was tiny. Cute. So cute, but I could’ve held him like a baby. [audience laughing] I look at me now and I think, “You know, as I age, surely to goodness I’m gonna get smaller.” My feet are getting bigger, my hands are getting bigger. [mumbling] I just walk around like that. [audience laughing] I take pictures with people and they’re, like, right up under here. But I thought that I was gonna marry that boy, and I thought we were gonna farm, we’re gonna grow dark-fired tobacco. And I’m gonna can our food, and we’re gonna have six kids, and we’re gonna let ’em play up in a car on blocks. [audience laughing] [laughs] Yeah. Ugh. So stupid I was. And my parents were like, “No, you are going, uh, to college or in the military.” I was like, “Oh, shit.” [audience laughing] “I cannot make it in the military. Lord.” “I can’t even mow.” But, anyway, I know this is a long way to talk about perimenopause. Just hold on with me. All right, so, we… Me and my high school boyfriend would get out in his ’79 Monte Carlo that was as long as this stage. And we would make out, and then I would go home to my precious mama, Lucille, and say, “Mama, I must’ve burned my neck.” [audience laughing] “I must’ve burned my neck on a curling iron.” [laughing continues] And she knew that was crazy, but anyway, she never made me feel shame, but then… All right, do y’all remember being in high school, and just hormones running through you, and you’re like, “I wanna…” “I wanna make out in a car”? [audience laughing] I remember. I wish I felt that way now. I wish I felt that way now. I could get a new purse out of that. [audience laughing wildly] If I said to my husband, “Chuck… suck my neck.” [audience laughing] “Suck my neck, Chuck.” [laughing continues] “As hard as yo',\n",
       "  'u can.” [laughing continues] “Until you put a bruise on me.” If I said that to him, I think he would have a heart attack. But he’d do it. [audience laughing] He would do it. But that’s when you’ve got all those hormones going in your teens and twenties. And then you start having babies, and you’re breastfeeding, and then everything starts getting wonky, and then you go through perimenopause, and then menopause. That’s what I’m in. I’m probably now on the other side of it. But that’s when I had no estrogen, no progesterone, and no testosterone. And that makes you real bitter and angry. [audience laughing] My husband’s testosterone dipped a little. Praise God. [laughing continues] Lord. Okay. So, you young girls, if I could give y’all any advice, and I know you haven’t asked me for it, you need to have that date night every week with your husband while your children are little and nurture that relationship with your husband, because one day these kids are gonna be gone, and you’re gonna look at him, and go, “Who are you?” He’s gonna say, “Who are you, and what do you want from me? And me and my husband… I’m really trying to build that intimacy back with their daddy. But his idea of intimacy is different from mine. [audience laughing] His idea of intimacy is something nasty. [laughing continues] And that’s okay. That’s the way God made him. That’s okay. My idea of intimacy is, “I wanna talk.” You know? “I wanna talk something to death.” He’ll go, “What do you wanna talk about?” I go, “I don’t know, but there’s somethin’ goin’ on with my bladder.” [audience laughing] So now it’s just me and him. This is what we talk about all the time, the thermostat. And I’ll just be honest, we fight. We fight about it. Well, I say that. I’ve beat him down. I’ve beat him down. But I wanna keep it on 68 because I wanna live through the night. He wants to put it back up into the 70s. And I know he’s cold, and I feel terrible over it. I know he’s cold. And I have that on 68, I have a fan coming this way, and I have a fan coming that way. And he’s just… His hair’s just blowing in the wind. [audience laughing] And sometimes he wears a half-zip golf pullover to bed. [laughing continues] But another reason why he does not want to run that thermostat is because he’s tight with money. He does not wanna spend money. He’ll say, “We don’t need to be blowin’ that thing all night.” My husband is one of the tightest people I’ve ever known in my life. And I mean that. His parents said to me before we got married, “You watch him.” “He’s like a squirrel, he’ll bury it in the yard.” [audience laughing] And thank God for him. Thank God for him, because if it were up to me, we’d be living in a hole. It’d be a fun hole. [audience laughing] But he has saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, and I have pissed, pissed, pissed, pissed, pissed… [laughing continues] …money away. I haven’t done anything crazy. I know people who’ve done a crazy mess. I don’t anything crazy. But I have bought a lot of pumpkin towels at T.J. Maxx. [audience laughing] I have. And he’s always told me, all of our married life, “This is it, we’re gonna lose everything.” “We’re about to lose everything. It’s gonna be a bad mobile home month.” And that wasn’t true. And I said to him lately, “Why’d you say that to me?” And he said, “I didn’t want you to do anything crazy.” I go, “What was I gonna do, buy all the pink Himalayan salt at T.J. Maxx?” He does not believe in joy. [audience laughing] [sighs] He believes in suffering. He’s got a thing about his family having nice cars. He doesn’t believe that any of us should have a nice vehicle. He thinks we should all drive old, beat-down vehicles until they fall apart in the interstate. It gives him joy to come have to pick us up at the interstate. My kids drive old, old cars. I finally put my foot down. I was driving a 2009 white Honda Pilot, and they are wonderful cars, but if you… if you don’t know what that model looks like, it looks like I was delivering Lay’s potato chips. [audience laughing] I never felt pretty in it. [laughing continues] It had over 239,000 miles on it, and lights started flashing in it saying, “Get out, Leanne.” “Get out.” He drives a 2007 Tahoe and the “T” and the “A” are missing. [audience laughing] But I feel bad because I wear these old gowns to bed that are loose because I got all those fans going and I’m hot. And so I’m wearing these old gowns, but I’ve held on to two little gowns. Cotton gowns, no big deal, got ’em at Target, no big deal. But every time I put one of those on, my husband’s like… [audience laughing loudly] You never know what’s gonna trigger him. [laughing continues] I have a good friend that said to me, she said, “I’ve got a gas fireplace in my master bedroom and I love that thing.” But every time I turn it on, Sam thinks we’re gonna do it. [audience laughing] She said, “I can’t even enjoy my own fireplace.” [laughing continues] All right, I know you boys have been waiting for me to talk about my panties. [audience laughing] I know. Calm down. You know, I named this “The Big Panty Tour.” I’ve done a hundred cities. This is winding it down. [audience cheering] Thank you. Thank y’all. Thank y’all. And people ask me all the time, “Why’d you name this The Big Panty Tour?” And I tell people, “I like big panties.” Big panties say to me, “Freedom!” [audience laughing] “Comf',\n",
       "  'ort.” I was wearing these tiny panties for years, and they were cuttin’ me in two. [laughing continues] I thought, “Who are these for, little children?” I love… Boys, are y’all watching? I love a high-cut brief. [audience laughing] I love a high-cut brief, and I like it to come over my stomach. [audience cheering] Thank you. [cheering continues] Thank you. Thank you, and the kind that I wear are called Vanity Fair Lingerie, Beyond Comfort. Beyond Comfort. And they are soft and luxurious, and they don’t ride up. They stay out of my crack. [audience laughing] I don’t want anything in my crack. I know. Love them. Okay. But I want you boys to know that I’ve held on to some tiny, little, hateful panties. I’ve kept them in a drawer, and I get those out every once in a while… in case some bills need to get paid, you know what I’m sayin’? [audience laughing] Yeah. That’s biblical. Let me tell y’all that my husband gives me wonderful gifts. Wonderful gifts. And I talk about how tight he is. And he is. My light features look like Game of Thrones. But he’s a wonderful gift-giver. He has given me beautiful gifts for years, and I’ve given him lame gifts. Lame gifts like a pair of khakis. And I had heard him all of our married life say, “I wish I could learn how to fly a plane.” But he would never spend that money on himself because he’d put me and these children first, and wanted everybody to get through school, and all that. So I got him the first few lessons, flight lessons to see if he even liked it. Well, he did, and now he’s about to get his pilot’s license. [audience cheering] I know! I know. He’s so smart. But let me tell you, I didn’t think that through. ‘Cause he said not long ago, “I’ll just start flying you everywhere.” And I thought, “Oh my Lord, he’s gonna buy an old, rickety little plane.” [audience laughing] And he believes in everybody working like a mule, 24 hours a day. Can’t relax. Everybody’s gotta work. So I could see him… All right, say he flew me home tomorrow from Lexington. And I’ve, you know, done five shows this weekend. I’ve got on a big girdle, and I’ve given it everything I had. And I’ll be tired in the morning. And I could hear him saying, “Okay.” “I know you’re tired, but we’re gonna crop dust on the way home.” [audience laughing] “I’m gonna need you to just lean out of this plane and throw some poison out.” [laughing continues] He did buy himself a used motorcycle, and he wanted to start riding motorcycles. And he did buy that for himself. And my little daddy, all of my life, has been scared to death something would happen to me or my sister. And he was like, “Don’t you dare get on a motorcycle.” That was one of the things. It would just scare me to death. I was like, “I’m not going to.” Well, my husband buys one, and says… Because we’re 30 minutes from the Smoky Mountains, “Let’s go ride in the mountains.” And I thought, “Oh my Lord.” “If I get on this thing, he’s gonna pull off into the bushes, and make me do something horrible.” [audience laughing wildly] And I can’t be scared and do it. All right, well, let me tell y’all. Let me get back to what it’s like, us going to bed. Okay. Young girls, when y’all get through this… When you start going through these hormonal changes, it’ll disrupt your sleep. Not everybody, but the majority of people, it will. And it did me. I haven’t slept in years. And I said to my nurse practitioner, “I can’t sleep.” And she said, “Do you want some Ambien?” And I was like, “I would love some Ambien, but will I get hooked on dope?” [audience laughing] Marijuana is not legal here in Kentucky, right? It’s not in Tennessee either. Okay. I don’t mean to scare y’all, but I travel all over the United States. And let me tell you something, everybody… everybody is high on marijuana. Everybody! Everywhere I go, I walk down the street, walk in the elevator… I didn’t know what was happening for a long time. And I thought, “Who’s boiling all this cabbage?” [audience laughing wildly] But my nurse practitioner got my compound pharmacist to make me a natural supplement pill that I keep by the bed. And it’s okay. It’s melatonin, L-theanine, GABA, passion flower, that kind of stuff. And I keep it by the bed in a pill bottle. And my husband is still tickled with me, if you know what I mean. And he comes into our bedroom, about every night, flaring his nostrils at me. [audience laughing] And I know what that means, and… I wish he’d speak to me. [laughing continues] That’d be fun. But he comes in, and flares his nostrils at me, and I say to him, “Okay, okay.” “Yes, we can do it.” Um… “But just know that if you hear that pill bottle shake, that means I’ve taken a pill.” “And that means that you’ve got less than 20 minutes.” [audience laughing] “And then my eyes are gonna roll back in my head.” “And then I’m gonna need you to leave me alone at that point.” And he gets hyper-focused on his phone, looking at sports or something. And then I’m over here with two beagles in the bed, in a gown, and praying to the dear Lord, “Please let me sleep through the night, Lord, please.” “Please let me sleep through the night.” And I drift off to sleep. And then my husband remembers me. [audience laughing] And I’m over here, dead to the world, and he reaches over, and grabs one of my breasts. [laughing continues] And it puts me into a blind rage. [audience clapping] All ',\n",
       "  'right, let me tell y’all about these precious children that I got to have. I got to have three, and I begged their daddy for a fourth baby. And he was so worried about making a living for all of us. He was like, “We can’t afford that, we don’t need to do it.” And probably about ten years after that, so I was probably about 48, 49 years old, he said, “You know, I was wrong.” “We’re never gonna have enough money. What difference does it make?” “Do you wanna have another baby?” And I said, “I’ve got plantar fasciitis.” [audience laughing] I’d leave a baby at Target by accident. But I got to have three. And my boy is my oldest, he’s 29, then I’ve got two girls. All right, my boy is… You know, we’re right next to the Smoky Mountains, so he’s grown up hiking, kayaking, fly-fishing, doing all that outdoorsy stuff, and he loves it. So when it was time for him to pick a college, he chose Berry College in Rome, Georgia, B-E-R-R-Y. What they’re known for, it’s the largest campus in the world. It’s 26,000 acres of reserve. There, you have mountain bike trails, all the stuff he loves. Rock climbing, all this stuff. There’s only 2,000 students there. So there are more deer than there are children. And they have these entrepreneurships. And everybody there has a job, has to work, but my boy started the cage-free egg enterprise and raised 200 chickens while he was in college, and sold the eggs to the local restaurants and cafeteria. And it’s still going to this day. [audience cheering and applauding] I know. Is that not darling? Yummy. Do y’all wanna know what I was doing at the University of Tennessee in 1983? [audience laughing] I was not raising chickens, honey. [laughing continues] I was doing horrible things. Horrible things. I was making horrible decisions. Horrible. I was dating people you wouldn’t wipe your feet on. [audience laughing] But I’m okay now. I’ve been washed in the blood, and I’ve been forgiven. [audience cheering and clapping] Thank you. My boy had a roommate all through college that was an outdoorsy little feller, and he had been in a gospel quartet in high school. And this little kid, his mama and daddy raised cattle, so this child knew all about cattle. So Berry College put this child in charge of hundreds of heads of cattle. You boys that are my age, do y’all remember that poster everybody had in their bedroom? All the boys had it in their dorm room. And it was that poster of Farrah Fawcett in that red bathing suit. Yes, with her nipple. [audience chuckling] Beautiful. I go to visit my boy and his roommate, and they’ve got posters of Jersey cows on the wall. [audience laughing] They had been out fishing or doing something and had found a little baby beaver that had been… her mom had been killed, or she had been abandoned, somethin’. They bring her back to the dorm room. I go to visit that weekend. I walk in, and my boy is holding a little baby beaver in the palm of his hand, feeding her a kitten bottle. And I said, “How do you even know what to feed her?” He said, “I’ve called the beaver hotline.” [audience laughing] [laughing continues] They named her Bathsheba. From the Bible. And all these boys in this dorm floor took care of Bathsheba when other people had to go to class, and they all loved her. And then some kid with some sense walked in one day and said, “I think this is illegal.” [audience laughing] “We’re not even supposed to have a dog in here, much less a wild beaver.” And my boy said, “I cannot give her up. I love her.” And his roommate said, “Charlie, she’s gonna grow up and eat your kitchen table.” [audience laughing] So they found a woman in Atlanta that takes care of wild animals on the down-low, and they transported a beaver in the middle of the night. And that woman took care of Bathsheba until Bathsheba got big enough to kill that little woman. [audience laughing] My boy met his wife his freshman year in class, and came home to me and said, “I’ve met the love of my life.” “She’s my best friend.” “This is who I’m gonna marry.” And I was like, “Who is this heifer?” [audience laughing] And I love my little daughter-in-law, and she’s like another child to me. She really is, but, Lord… Okay, you younger girls, if y’all got sons, I’m not trying to scare you, but they will grow up and you will have to hand him over to somebody else. And it is a booger. And I love her, but two weeks before they got married, I took to the bed. [audience laughing] I took to the bed and bawled my eyes out, and he came to me and said, “You need to get a hold of yourself.” They had a beautiful big wedding, and that morning I got my hair and makeup professionally done. You would never know it. Every picture, I’m going… [audience laughing] [mouthing] But everything turned out beautiful, and let me tell you what wonderful thing comes out of that. They have had my first grandbaby. [audience cheering] Thank y’all. We are having a ball. That yummy baby is two years old now, and he is precious. And people would say to me, “It’s the best thing that happens to you.” And I feel like I received that, but you don’t know until you have ’em. Oh my gosh, if we are not having a ball. I hope I’m his best friend. He’s my best friend. And every time I see him, I say, “I’m buying you a camper.” [audience laughing] And then my husband says, “Oh, yeah, Leanne, just throw money.” “Just throw money.” [audie',\n",
       "  \"nce laughing] “You don’t need a camper. You don’t know how to camp.” [whining] “You need to rent a camper to see if you like camping.” [audience laughing] Y’all should see how beautiful and stout this baby is. I’m a big woman, my husband is 6’4″, we breed big kids. This baby eats chicken and steak by the fistfuls. And we just go, “Hercules, Hercules, Hercules!” Y’all should see him in the yard with no shirt on, mowing with a bubble mower. [audience laughing] Oh my Lord. Beautiful. I was in an Uber with a man up north, and this man… We were talking about our grandchildren, and he’s got a grandson, and he’s in love with him, and he said, “I love him so much that if he came to me and said, ‘Granddaddy, I’ve killed somebody, I’m gonna need some help.'” He said, “I’d do it.” [audience laughing] And the first thing I thought was, “I’m in an Uber with a man who would cover up a murder.” [laughing continues] And then the second thing I thought was, “I’d help my baby cover up a murder.” [audience laughing] When my boy and his wife found out about this precious baby, they would say, “Their baby.” And we would say, “Our baby.” And then they started using words like “boundaries.” [audience laughing] They’d start saying things like, “Oh, yeah, so-and-so needs to place some boundaries with her mother and father-in-law.” And I just smiled, and kept my mouth shut, and went… And I thought to myself, “They don’t know what’s about to hit them.” [audience laughing] They’re gonna have this precious baby, and they’re gonna be up all night. And that’s gonna go into weeks and months. And then my little daughter-in-law’s gonna start hallucinating. And then she’s gonna wake up in the night and she’ll be breastfeeding a lamp. [audience laughing] And we’ll see who’s got boundaries. [laughing continues] [audience applauding] Thank you. [audience cheering] Thank you. Thank y’all. Well, I was right. I was right. I’m the mama, I know everything. So, they work full time, both of them, and my daughter-in-law has been going to MBA school at night and on the weekends. So they are so tired and crazy, they don’t even know their own name. They don’t even call us anymore. They just let that little baby off in the yard. [audience laughing] We get him any time we want him. [audience clapping] Thank y’all. And we want him all the time. My husband, I said to him the other day, “Do you wish we could raise him?” And he said, “I am gonna raise him.” [audience laughing] Do you girls that are my age, do y’all remember that book What to Expect When You’re Expecting? Yeah, that was a hateful book. [audience laughing] It said things like, “You’re gonna have a hemorrhoid in the seventh month, on the fourth day at two o’clock in the afternoon.” And I’d be like, “That’s crazy.” [audience laughing] Back then, everybody was worried to death about a food allergy. And I wanted everything to be perfect with my first baby. And I had charts hanging in my kitchen. And I made sure that I didn’t give him squash until I cleared sweet potatoes. And I was so anal-retentive about it. And I did well with my second baby, did well with her, but that third baby… We were at McDonald’s. And… [audience laughing] She was sitting in a high chair. I remember it like it was yesterday. And she didn’t have teeth yet, and I took a cheeseburger, and flung it onto her high chair. And she gummed it down. [audience laughing] And my other two were playing in the balls and the tube. And I remember a woman coming over intercom, and she said, “Ma’am, your baby has pooped in the tube.” [audience laughing] So I had to crawl up in that tube, get my baby, pull my baby down. Mine loved the balls. I don’t even know if they have balls anymore, because of all the disease going around. Mine loved the balls. Mine would be playing in the balls, having a big time. And then a dirty diaper would go floating across. [audience laughing] They’d find a chicken nugget that wasn’t theirs and go… [laughing continues] They were horrible. Okay, my middle child is my oldest daughter. And you may have seen a video about me talking about how hateful she was when she was a teenager. [audience member whoops] Thank you. Well, I’m not taking that back. [audience laughing] We were scared to death of her. If you’ve got a teenage girl and you’re going through that, let me give you this hope, they’re gonna come out of that. It’s gonna take a long time, but they’re gonna come out of that, and then they come back around, and end up your very best friend. I know! Girls. Yummy. Okay, she takes care of me just like I’m her baby now. She calls and checks on me, calls me three or four times a day. “Mom, did you get where you’re going? Are you in Des Moines?” “Are you all right?” I go, “Yeah, baby, thank you. Tell your daddy.” [audience laughing] She decided to go to the University of Tennessee. And it’s only 20 minutes down the road from us, but we never saw her because she was very involved on campus. And she was in a sorority, and she lived at the sorority house, was on their executive board. And let me brag on her a little bit and tell y’all that she was on the homecoming court of that big SEC school. And she looked like a movie star. [audience cheering] Thank you. Thank y’all. And I’m telling y’all that because I live through her. [audience laughing] Nobody ever asked me to be on the homecoming court becau\",\n",
       "  \"se I was smoking cigarettes behind the dumpster. [laughing continues] She has a heart for children going through severe illness, so she went to work for Make-A-Wish right out of college, and then now she raises money in Knoxville for East Tennessee Children’s Hospital, and is in development with them. [audience clapping] Thank you. Thank you. And being in non-profit, she doesn’t care a thing in the world about material things or money, she really doesn’t. And she had a big birthday, and I said, “This is a big one.” “Let’s get you something really good. What do you want?” And she said, “Well, I could use some new prescription glasses.” [audience laughing] I said, “Oh, fun.” “We’ll get you those, and how about we get you a flu shot to go with it?” [audience laughing] My baby child is 24, my youngest daughter, and she’s a professional makeup artist. Some of y’all may have seen her do videos on me during the pandemic. [audience clapping] Thank you. Well, she loves money. She loves money. And very bougie. So if you saw her do videos on me, just know I had to Venmo her right after it was over. [audience laughing] But, no, she’s been a joy and a doll. I had my children all real close together. My girls are 20 months apart. And so when I had her, it was a blur. And I gotta tell you, I was beat down. And I did not know my own name. I did the best I could with what I had at the time. I really tried, did the best I could. But I let her do whatever she wanted to. I did. She’s turned out good for all that. Okay, are there any teachers in here? [scattered clapping] Okay, we didn’t hear them clap big ’cause they raised her hand. [audience laughing] Sweet. I don’t know how y’all do it. God did not call me to do it. If I was a teacher, I’d be running out this highway with my bra on the outside of my clothes. [audience laughing] My teachers for my children were wonderful and helped me so much. And they liked me, and I loved them, and they invited me on every field trip. They did. I got to go on every field trip with three children. And y’all know why they invited me? Because I’m fun. And I’m not a butthole. [audience laughing] So if you’re not getting invited on the field trips… [laughing continues] …you may wanna look inward. [laughing continues] But I want y’all to know that with those first two, I was on top of my game. I really was. I was helping in the classroom, and I was bringing muffins, and I was all up in there. At then at night, I would be doing flashcards, and I’d be drilling those first two. “You’re gonna make 100 on this spelling test and I mean it!” And they were scared to death. That third baby… I remember asking one of her teachers, “Can she read?” [audience laughing] We went to meet her first-grade teacher. And I, we… I had a minivan, and I know… I know we got there. I know they had clothes on. When they were little bitty, it was just like a swarm of bees, and I don’t even know how we got anywhere, I was so crazy. And we went to meet this first-grade teacher, and I just didn’t pay attention to what was goin’ on. And we walk in there, and this first-grade teacher has no makeup on and Birkenstocks. And I look down, and my baby child, six years old, has got on full contour makeup. Lee Press-On Nails, they’re this long, and she’s going… [audience laughing] And I thought, “Oh, shit.” [laughing continues] My husband is very, very smart in math, and has an undergraduate and then a master’s in some kind of math something. I don’t know. Our first date, he said, “I love a derivative,” and I remember thinking, “Okay.” [audience laughing] “Why? Okay.” But he bred with me and has three children that cannot do math. All of them took after me. But they’re fun. They’re fun. [audience laughing] And they’re not buttholes, you know? [audience clapping] I know, thank you. So when my baby child was in third grade, they started that old, mean long division, and she hated it. During long division, she’d go up to her teacher and go, “Phew.” “I got a sick headache.” “I’m gonna need an ibuprofen.” And her teacher would send her to the nurse’s office, which really wasn’t a nurse. That was my friend Susie that was volunteering. And Susie would give her a Diet Coke and a chocolate chip cookie, and they would sit with their legs crossed, and gossip about people. [audience laughing] I was very strict with those first two about language. I said, “Nobody is gonna call anybody ‘stupid’ or ‘butt.'” “If you call somebody ‘stupid’ or ‘butt, ‘ you’re gonna be in deep doo-doo, and I mean it.” And they were scared to death. They would have never. That third baby, she started out with some spell-cussing. Little bitty, walk in a room, and go, “What the H?” [audience laughing] She’s always called her daddy “Chuck.” She’d go, “Chuck, you a-hole.” [audience laughing] And my husband is old-school. He doesn’t take crap off of anybody, and he’d go… [audience laughing] “She’s a nut.” And the oldest two would go, “What?” “She just called Dad an a-hole!” She was little bitty, walk into somebody’s birthday party and go, “What’s up, mofos?” [audience laughing] [exclaims] Terrible. I had that thing about words and bad language, because I think my little mama and daddy never said ugly words, ever. And there was never alcohol in our house until my sister was gonna marry a little later in life, and she was gonna marry this hoopty-doo ma\",\n",
       "  'n. And when I say “hoopty-doo,” I mean country club. Some country club people like to drink. So we all, to get her married off, started drinking. [audience laughing] And my little mama, had never had alcohol, got out of my car. She had two and a half glasses of wine, and said, “I can’t feel my arms.” [audience laughing loudly] Okay. All right. Let me tell you this last thing. So my husband does work for that big mobile home company, and he has worked for them for over 25 years, and it’s been a blessing to our family. But one of the perks there that they give us is they send us on these trips, unbelievable trips all over the world. And I’ve loved them, and it’s been wonderful, but a little stressful at the same time. Because most of the time it’s somewhere tropical, um, and that’s in late January, early February. But sometimes it’ll be like Alaska, somewhere like that. Sometimes it’s been overseas. But say, for instance, Alaska. And they all… We sign up for excursions before we go. And, uh, let me tell you, I don’t mind an excursion. I wanna go and kiss a husky puppy in the mouth. [audience laughing] I’ll do that. But, oh, no, everybody that goes signs up for these scary, scary excursions. One time we went to Alaska, and my husband signed us up to go on a float plane to see a glacier. And we walk up to this dock, and there was this little float plane floating in the water. And they line us up on this dock, and this little crusty man with a pack of Marlboro Reds comes up to me and says, “What do you weigh?” [audience laughing] And I lied. I lied. [laughing continues] And I watched nine more people… He has nine more people, and I watch them all lie. And I thought, “Oh my Lord.” “We’re gonna go down.” We all get in this tiny little float plane, and they put these big old headphones on us. And somebody’s narrating, I think it’s Wink Martindale. [audience laughing] And all the sudden, this little man starts pumping his foot. Pumping his foot, that’s how we get in the air. He’s pumping that plane. [audience laughing] I don’t know if I saw a glacier, I don’t know if I saw one. One, because it was all white everywhere, but also, I was praying. I was praying. And I took my purse handles, and took ’em around my neck, and put that purse on in case somebody needed to identify my body. [audience laughing] There was another time that we went to Alaska, and my husband signed us up for the largest zip line in North America. And we got on a rickety school bus with a high school boy driving that was high on marijuana. And he drove us up to the top of that mountain. And we all got out, and he said, “Okay, listen, there’s a couple of grizzlies that live up here.” “If they pop up out of that rock, just run.” [audience laughing] All right, let me tell y’all that being from Adams, Tennessee, we went on vacations. But my mom and dad had a farm, they still have their farm, and they raised me and my sister, put us through school. They had a meat processing plant, and they did everybody’s meat in Middle Tennessee and Kentucky. So they worked like Trojans. So we went on vacations, but it was… You know, we couldn’t go far most of the time. We’d go to Florida every once in a while. Most of the time, we’d go to Gatlinburg, ’cause my little daddy loves Gatlinburg, and he still loves it. And… I try to take him when I can. And this is the one memory they have of me growing up, and they bring it up every Thanksgiving and Christmas. And they say, “Remember when we were in Gatlinburg, and Leanne was 18 months old, and ate that cigarette butt off the ground?” [audience laughing] And I think, “Is that the only thing y’all remember about me?” So I had never been on these kind of trips that I’m talking about, so… Most of the time, these trips are somewhere tropical, and that’s all wonderful. And I don’t mean to sound that I’m not grateful for it, but… that means that I’ve gotta go and try on a bathing suit in the dead of winter before the end of January, early February, and I’d rather take a bullet. [audience laughing] And I’m sure there are some girls here tonight that love to try on a bathing suit in the dead of winter, but us East Tennessee girls like to eat pork sausage. [audience laughing] And I’ve been prepping for this trip for 25 years, and I think every year, “I’m gonna do better.” “I’m gonna do better. I’m gonna tone. I’m gonna do better.” “And I’m gonna…” “I don’t have to buy a Miraclesuit this year.” “I won’t have to buy a one-piece bathing suit with a girdle in it.” “No.” And don’t ever buy a lavender one. Okay. [audience laughing] I can’t even think about going on one of these trips until I can get through Christmas. And I don’t mean to sound like everything falls on me, but everything falls on me. I love my family, but they don’t do anything to help me. I do all the decorating, the cooking, the cleaning, the wrapping, the shopping, all that. Last year on December 24th, my husband said to me, “Can I help you do anything?” [audience laughing] And I said, “I’m gonna beat you to death.” And I can’t think about this trip, ’cause I gotta get ready for Christmas. And I get so torn up that I wanna take to the bed. I wanna take to the bed, but I can’t take to the bed, ’cause if I take to the bed, nobody’s gonna have Christmas. And in my twisted mind, I think, “Oh, I can lose 40 pounds in four weeks.” [audience laugh',\n",
       "  'ing] “Yeah, I’ll be all right.” “I can just do Weight Watchers again.” Because that’s been so successful for me. I’ve done every diet in the world. My mama, and my sister, and I took Dexatrim. When I was 17 years old… I’m the youngest. You could buy it everywhere. Do y’all remember Dexatrim? [audience agreeing] Yeah. It was speed. [audience laughing] We took speed as a family. [audience clapping] We would take Dexatrim, and our heads would itch, and we’d fight in the yard. [audience laughing] We did. [laughs] So, one day… One day, I was looking through my VHS tapes, and I pop this VHS tape into this old VHS tape player that’s in my children’s playroom. And I thought, “Who are those people?” [audience laughing] This was a VHS tape of me and my husband on one of these trips doing a snorkeling excursion in Maui. And we had moved to San Antonio. My husband had gotten a big promotion to be over South Texas, and he gives 150% at everything he does. So he was torn up over that, and trying to do the best he could. And I’d moved these little children from Tennessee to Texas, and I was torn up. And that was the first time I got the shingles. And instead of coping effectively, and getting out and jogging, we ate tortillas. [audience laughing] I pop this VHS tape in. I thought, “Who are these people?” [laughing continues] It was me and my husband. I did not recognize us. We were so bloated and pale from eating tortillas. Our heads were this big. You could not fit ’em in a bushel basket. All right, so this whole VHS tape… And I’ll release it someday, ’cause let me tell you, everybody on that boat was from my husband’s company, except this honeymoon couple down here on the right, down right at the bottom, and they were practically fornicating. [audience laughing] So I’ll release it so y’all can watch. Okay? We get on this boat, and I remember it like it was yesterday. The first person that came to us was this stunning woman. I’ve never seen somebody as pretty in a bikini in my life. Beautiful, tan, blond. She goes, “I’m gonna film all day.” “Do y’all want me to film y’all on the boat and in the water?” “And it’s this amount of money.” And it was a lot. It was very expensive. And I went, “Yes!” And… [audience laughing] And my husband was like… handing her a credit card. And we got on this boat, and I don’t… You know, people were already partying, and I don’t like all that kind of stuff. And I don’t like to go out in the middle of the ocean. I was freaked out. And so I remember I had one of those patches on that keeps you from vomiting but it gives you double vision at the same time. [audience laughing] And everybody’s on that boat, having a big time. And somebody’s cooking Chinese food, and somebody’s serving alcohol, and everybody’s having a big time. And there’s a man that teaches you how to snorkel on the way out there in ten minutes. And he gives us all this snorkeling equipment. And I’ve got, you know, all this on. He puts a big, old floater thing on me with a strap, and throws me into the ocean. And I feel something. “Is that an eel?” [audience laughing] “Is that an eel?” And then my husband floats up to me. He’s got on a big pair of goggles and a big thing in his mouth. Takes that thing out, and looks at me, and says, “You want to do it?” [audience laughing loudly] [audience applauding] And I said, “Get away from me!” And through this whole VHS tape… But I remember it like it was yesterday. He is twirling. And diving. Twirling, diving, and doing all this. And the first thing I thought… My heart dropped when I thought, “Is he showing off in front of this woman in the bikini?” “Is he having unbiblical thoughts about her?” Then I took a beat and I thought, “No, that’s not who he is. That’s not who he is.” And I thought, “Oh, I know what it is.” “He doesn’t like to spend money. This is costing a lot.” I know in his mind, he thought, “I’m gonna freaking twirl.” [audience laughing] So he’s twirling, and doing, and doing, and doing. He had been taking Propecia for about a year, to grow this one patch of hair out. And Propecia works, let me tell you. It works. Through this whole VHS tape, this one patch of hair. [audience laughing] And then all of the sudden, this big, lavender thing… [audience laughing] [laughing continues] …comes across the screen. And I think, “What is that?” “Is that a turtle?” [audience laughing] Thank y’all! Thank y’all! [audience cheering] Thank y’all!

Recorded Live at The Paramount Theater, Huntington, New York in May 2022. * * * * * * [whooshing] [marker scraping] [“Enter Sandman” by Metallica playing] [doorbell rings] [door opens] [tabletop squeaking] [“Enter Sandman” by Metallica continues playing] [Host] Ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Black! [audience cheering] Now that’s the… sound of an audience that hasn’t been out for a while. [audience laughing] I’m really thrilled… at the level of excitement you’re bringing this evening. [audience cheering] Tone it down. [audience laughing] You know, I… ’cause I really… really wish I was… even half as excited as you are. [audience laughing] But I think… I think that music, you know… is… [audience member cheering] Eh! It’s… I mean, it’s great, but it’s over the top. It creates an expectation in this room that, you know, you hear this and you get fucking pumped and you think what’s gonna come out. You know, jugglers and sword swallowers and fire eaters and gymnasts and fucking wild animals even. Jaguars and tigers and… and then… and then just one aging Jew wanders on the stage. [audience laughing] And let me just say, I know that for those of you who came here tonight and don’t know me. You were probably just a bit shocked. You thought… “I came all the way for this?” And if you don’t know me, I’m just going to tell you upfront. This…uh… This could be a long night. [audience laughing] It really could. And if you get upset tonight… uh… it’s on you. [audience cheering] It’s… It’s not on me. OK? All right, you had ample opportunity, OK? Including the pandemic which gave you a fucking ton of time. So do a little research and kind of see who you were coming… Oh, I’m gonna go see this person. But you fucking didn’t. You didn’t do your homework. If you had children and you went to a movie you’d read the review, wouldn’t you? And you’d sit there and go, you know, so that when you ended up at the movie with your kids, you didn’t find yourself in the middle of it going, “Fuck, they killed everybody!” [audience laughing] So what’s gonna happen is… I’m gonna say some things and you’re not really gonna hear them. What you’re going to hear is that you’re gonna feel as if I have challenged your basic belief system. You’re going to feel that somehow I have fucking insulted you on a level you never imagined. [audience cheering] And… what I’ve said, all I said was a joke. That was it. Just a joke. But what you’re going to hear is, “Your mother sucks cocks in hell!” [audience laughing] And that isn’t what I said. [audience laughing] OK? It’s not even close. And you have to understand, OK, that I have been doing this for a long time, and… never have I said anything on the stage that has changed fucking anything. [audience laughing] Thousands and thousands of people have come and watched me and the next day woke up and went, [blows raspberry] “It’s still the same.” And you should know that since I started doing it, things have gotten worse. [audience laughing] So realize that there… and I know this will shock some of you, there are people who actually came out tonight to see me, OK? And they… they overpaid. [audience laughing] And so I really need you to make this evening, don’t fuck up their evening, OK? Don’t… Just sit there, all right? If I say a joke and you don’t think it’s funny, you get to nail me. And the way you get to nail me is you don’t laugh. That’s it. All right? And you let your nipples turn bright red… and you shut the fuck up. [audience cheering] ‘Cause if you mess up this evening, OK? I’m gonna tell my mother. And when she find',\n",
       "  's out, your life is gonna be fucking hell. OK? And I mean this. You don’t fuck with my mother, all right? She’s 103. So she– [audience cheering] My mother’s 103. Sometimes I feel like she’s a tortoise that’s escaped her shell, [audience laughing] I mean, it’s kind of remarkable, 103. I am blessed really to have spent all of that time with her, but… she’s 103. And to give you an idea, just how tough, I mean she practiced on me, OK? And this is how, this is one of the last things she said when I saw her recently. Just to give you a taste of what’s coming for you. [audience laughing] She said to me… Actually, to the caregiver there, “He… He just put me to sleep. I can’t imagine what he does to an audience.” She’s good. 103, so sometimes she’s here… and sometimes… Ooh, she’s there, but I’m lucky and so is she that we she does not have Alzheimer’s, no dementia. What she has is something that doctors haven’t given a name to yet. She just makes shit up. [audience laughing] When the fuck were you in Thailand? [audience laughing] She’s claimed that she raised an entire family, another family. And the son, who is as old as I am, apparently is nicer to her than I’ve ever been. [audience laughing] She’s, uh… in competition now with the Bezos and Musk and Branson. Those are the three who were, you know, you know them. They’re launching their penises into space. [audience laughing] They are whacking off into the universe. They’re spending billions, billions to get out there. My mother has been orbiting the earth on a regular basis for 12 years. [audience laughing] And I wouldn’t even call where she lived assisted living. I call it a launchpad. [audience laughing] And she doesn’t spend billions because her rocket fuel is oatmeal. [audience laughing] It was a long time. It was about three, it was more than a year, just a chunk more than a year that it took from me. I didn’t get to see my mother for that long. You know, she was in this place she’s living. It was in a lockdown. I could not get to visit her. It was 500 days from my last performance till the time I performed again. Five hundred days. And the last time I performed, in front of an audience before the whole thing shut down, was on March 13th, and I was in New Buffalo, Michigan at a casino there. And I knew that things were coming to an end. I knew that we were moving into a shutdown, OK? Because myself and a friend of mine, who many of you know, it was another, really a great comic, Kathleen Madigan. [audience cheering] She and I… She and I, from the moment that that virus hit, from the moment we heard about it, we tracked that son of a bitch every day, every fucking day. We were like the Fauci and Birx of the comedy community. [audience laughing] We were on the phone. “Did you hear that? Did you hear what’s happening? They fucked up, somebody left the door open to the lab. Somebody got on the goddamn boat, it’s coming our way. Close the harbors. Those fuckers have to close the harbors.” [audience laughing] Nobody listened. [audience laughing] But we knew it was out there. We knew it was coming. And luckily I was at least in a position, I kind of knew this was gonna be my last show because the show on March 14th that I was gonna have had been canceled. She, however, was on her way to the airport to get on a plane to Reno. I said, “Turn back! You don’t wanna get on that fucking plane. You don’t wanna end up in Reno. Son of a bitch, they’re gonna hold you there for God knows how long, ’cause they’re gonna need at least one person to gamble.” [audience laughing] They talked about closing my show on the 13th. They said, “We may not go through with it.” But they were kind of stuck because 1500 fuckers had shown up. And we knew this, I knew it because they were in the casino, standing shoulder to shoulder. That did not bode well. [audience laughing] There they were. And I was there. I was at a very safe distance. I was, well, fuck I was watching ’em through binoculars. That night I went on stage. It was a sold out house. I really didn’t know what to say. I’d never been in this position before. Nobody knew what was coming next. And I stared out at them and the first thing that came into my mind was, “Well, woo, thanks for risking your life.” [tepid laughter] I got a bigger laugh that night. [audience laughing] And so… So I finished up, I walked off the stage, one of the strangest performances, great in many ways, odd in others, and I went into my dr',\n",
       "  'essing room and I flashed on that thing they say about comics that I’d never thought about in this way before. You know… “Boy, he really killed ’em tonight.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] On March 14th, it was time. I could go home. I was supposed to fly through O’Hare. I was not gonna go through O’Hare because I knew and Kathleen knew that the first time that COVID went from one person to another in this country was at O’Hare. That’s the kind of shit I knew. So I’m not going to that fucking airport. I don’t have a hazmat suit. And O’Hare on a good day is a shithole. [audience laughing] And so I am very lucky I had a tour bus and I got onto that and I was gonna return back to New York City. And on the way, I was gonna stop for provisions. There’s a word you don’t hear anymore. [audience laughing] That’s a word you actually hear if you’re on a wagon train going west. [audience laughing] But I say provisions, ’cause I knew I was gonna have to pick up a lot of shit. And so, we stopped. I stopped for the first time ever and went into, and this’ll stun you, a Walmart. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah, I know. I’d never been in one, but why would a single person who’d never been duck hunting go to a Walmart? I mean, unless I needed a hundred pound tub of butter for fun. Or, you know, but I was gonna need 300 fucking rolls of toilet paper, so I’m going to Walmart. And I had never been, I walked in, it was like the Vatican. The Vatican of fatty fuck foods. They didn’t even put the foods together in terms of the same product of food, the same fruits. No, it was the level of fat. Fat, fattier, most fatty, the most fatty fat-fat fucking fattiest fateus. Holy shit, there was actually one of those warning lights, the red light was spinning at one place, sirens going off. That was the aisle that said, “You might have a heart attack here.” It’s the first place I’ve ever been into that the soup actually had whipped cream on it. [audience laughing] If you walk around a Walmart literally for three minutes, you will gain seven pounds. [audience laughing] And so I headed home… and we got into New York and on, uh… March 15th, March 15th. You have to speak into the microphone, asshole. Yeah, that was really a private moment. [man in audience] We love you, Lewis. And I love you. [audience cheering] On March 15th, I was very excited. It was either on March 15th or maybe a day or two after. I can’t quite place it, but it was the day in which for the first time… our government was gonna come on and… on the TV and tell us the people how we were going to deal with the coming pandemic. Not only as a group, but individually. I was so excited. I called Kathleen, I said, “Fuck, we’re not in charge anymore.” [audience laughing] Now we’ve got real experts who’ll be telling us exactly what to do. [audience laughing] And I was thrilled. I sat down there and, and the first people we saw for the first time ever were Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. There they were. There they were. And I know that some of you, for sure, have problems with Dr. Fauci and I… [audience member shouting] Yes, one person screaming in the night. [audience laughing] Who the problem sounded like a sexual one there. [audience laughing] But Dr. Fauci, look, if you had a problem with Dr. Fauci, I’m just gonna tell you this, all right? Would you want his job? Would you wanna do what he did? Would you want to be that person who had to come out every day? What, you’re yelling at him because of what? ‘Cause he has the shittiest job on earth and you wouldn’t do the job, OK? Nobody wanted that fucking job. We’re lucky anybody took the job. [audience cheering] To come out there and say, “It sucks.” The next day, “It really sucks. It’s gonna suck more.” Here’s the sound. [sucking air] That’s how sucky it is. [audience laughing] Everywhere you go, suck, suck, suck. It’s gonna be shittier and shittier and fucking unbelievable. Worst job ever. Son of a bitch, the only job that I think could be worse is if you were douching elephants for a living. [audience laughing] Unbelievable, and people were pissed with Fauci. “Oh, he got money from Pfizer.” Fuck you, that was a lie. “Oh, but he was rich.” Oh, you idiots. Of course he was rich. He’s a doctor, numb nuts. [audience cheering] I believe that who they should have hired to do the job, I think what would’ve made it possible for everybody in the country to not be upset was they should have just had a fucking pea',\n",
       "  'cock. I mean it. The peacock should have come out with the announcement every day. And the peacock could’ve strolled, you know, [imitates peacock sound] or whatever noise a peacock make. Then underneath, there’d be a fucking translation of the peacock. [audience laughs] And then everybody would watch. They turn the TV on, “I can’t wait to see what the peacock has to say!” [audience laughs] And Fauci and Birx stood there, and they began to speak and none of us knew what the fuck they were talking about. We’d never heard or seen anything like this in our lives, ever. And goddammit it. And about a third of the way through, it was becoming clearer and clearer what they were saying. It was really quite simple. And what they were saying was, “We’re fucked! We’re totally fucked!” [audience laughs] At this point… our leader… pushed them aside. And with nary a stethoscope in sight, [audience laughs] he strode to the mic because he wanted to be sure we remain calm. And he knew that these two weren’t going to help. So, he decided he was going to tell us how we were going to deal with what was going to be happening. And he could do that because he is the first president ever elected… ever… [male audience laughs] Thank you. [audience laughs] The first President ever elected who just…[inhales] knows stuff. [audience laughs] Yeah, look, I’ve been through… [audience cheers and applauds] I have lived through a lot of presidents. And none of them knew shit. [audience laughs] But this president really was fucking on top of the game. This president knew fucking every fucking thing you could know. Not these idiots. Goddammit. All of a sudden, finally. [chuckles] He knew how much wood a woodchuck would… if a woodchuck could chuck wood. He knew how many cords. He knew how many cords of wood. [audience laughs] He memorized all of the recipes in The Betty Crocker Cookbook. [audience laughs] Yes, he did. Yes, he fucking did. Why? Because he can do it. And at this point, he explained just how the virus would come to us and what would happen. And he said it would be like the flu. [audience laughs] It would just come and then… woo, it would go. [audience laughs] It is what he said. And…[sucking air] he got the timeline off. [audience laughs] But everybody got the timeline off. Everyone did. They’re still not sure about the timeline, OK? He got it off. He was wrong, OK? And the reason everybody has been wrong is because everybody’s got a fucking theory about how this virus came to be, all right? And I’m the only one who actually knows what happened. [audience laughs] And, yeah, that’s right. And lucky, lucky you are here with me this evening. [audience wooing] So that I can tell you the story. Yes. Many people think, “Oh, it came out of the lab in Wuhan.” It did not come out of that lab. That would require intelligence, all right? And when intelligence is involved, this kind of shit doesn’t happen. This happens when it’s… when something fucking stupid happens. And what happened was this, quite simply, somebody fucked a bat. Somebody fucked a bat. Somebody fucked a bat. I don’t think you’re listening. Somebody fucked a bat. Someone said, “Hey, I’m gonna fuck a bat.” [audience laughs] They saw a bat. They said, “Oh, look at how cute that bat is. I’m gonna fuck that bat.” They took their little ears of that bat and pushed him down on the table, pulled their penis out, and put it inside a bat. I know. It disgusts me to talk about it. [audience laughs] Makes me sick. [audience laughs, cheers and applauds] In… And listen closely, in the first draft of the Old Testament, I don’t, I don’t think you heard me. [audience laughs] In the very first draft of the Old Testament, all right? In that draft that was there, you know, many Christians believe that God just wrote that book. Just wrote it. And every Jew knows that something that is that well written took a number of fucking rewrites. [audience laughs] And so, in the first draft, it should be noted that God said, before he tells Adam and Eve not to eat the apple, he says “whatever you do, don’t fuck a bat. [audience laughs] All hell will break loose.” [audience laughs] And as you read now, it isn’t there. No, in the ensuing drafts, never comes back. Because God thought, “Hey, who’s gonna fuck a bat?” [audience laughs] So, after listening to all of this, I have to say that I felt much like I felt when I was in elementary school when I was like nine. And the teacher said, “in ',\n",
       "  'case of a nuclear attack, get under your desk.” [audience laughs] And I said, “Why would I do that?” And she said, “Because you’ll burn faster.” [audience laughs and applauds] So… I learned a number of important things that day. And the most important was that I was a target for COVID. I learned that pretty, pretty quickly. Because I was old. And let me say, until that fucking virus showed up, I didn’t know I was fucking old! [audience laughs] And… I had an underlying condition. And so, I knew I was, I was screwed. And that I was gonna have to lock down, that I was gonna have to go into solitary confinement in my apartment alone. I would be alone. And it was for twelve weeks. And I learned from that experience that solitary confinement is a fucking punishment. I mean, for four days, it’s fun. Oh, it’s a treat. Your brain is having the time of its life. It goes through everything that ever happened to you. And it looks at it from all sides, types of sizes, everything, every, all the sides, everything you could imagine, “Oh, and this could have happened. And that could have happened.” And your brain is all excited. It’s like your whole life is a jungle gym for your brain, and it can’t be more thrilled to be spending this time, and you get to literally be disgusted by everything that had disgusted you. And now you can even be madder and madder. Your brain can go right after it. And that lasts for four days. And then your brain gets fucking bored. And when your brain is bored, it comes after you! [audience laughs] And holy fuck, then it was like the goddamn Nuremberg trials day after day. “You fucked up this relationship. You fucked up this relationship, then you fucked up this relationship. You want to know why you’re alone? ‘Cause you fucked up that relationship. Then you fucked up this relationship. She didn’t even want to spend any time with you. And you spent some time and not even you fucked that up. And goddammit, and you… children. Oh, she wanted to have children. Who the fuck would want you as a parent, you piece of shit? If you had children, there’d be people all around. But you didn’t, did you? Because you fucked up that relationship because you said, “Oh, I don’t want children. I want to have a career.” Well, look around the living room. Where’s your fucking career now? [laughing]” [audience cheers and applauds] [audience cheering] Then my friends would call me and they would say that thing we all said. We all said in the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, we all said, it’s the dumbest thing anybody could fucking say. “How are you doing?” [audience laughing] “How are you doing?” Are you shitting me?! How the fuck do you think I’m doing, asshole? I’m trying not to die! Goddammit, I’m living like a raccoon. I’m washing every thing that comes into the apartment, goddammit. Only I’m wearing rubber gloves, and I’m scrubbing everything down. All of my fruits and vegetables. I’m scrubbing ’em down with Clorox, scrubbing them down, scrubbing them down. I thought my friends would come to the house and find me dead on the floor. Then they call my other friends. “Lewis died.” “What happened?” “Well, he had Clorox poisoning. [audience laughing] He died the way we always thought he would die. He died ’cause he’s a fucking moron.” Meanwhile, there were all of those folks out there, all of those folks who the pandemic for them was the greatest thing that ever happened. There were tons of those people. It was like a renaissance for them. [audience member whistles] Please, that actually could have broken eardrums, you fuck. [audience laughing] Goddammit. I asked, just ’cause I didn’t say do not whistle, I thought it was inherent. [audience laughing] I almost had a dog pop outta my ass. [audience laughing] [Lewis barking] There were those people. One is here this evening, [audience laughing] one who learned how to become a professional whistler. But it is, people were doing all sorts of stuff. Fucking unbelievable. I’m miserable, and these fucking people… How did that happen? How did you get six new degrees in 12 weeks? What the fucks going on? Son of a bitch. Just extraordinary to me. You turn the TV on every day. Every one of those morning shows had one of those pricks on it. “Oh, I just came up with 13 new sourdough starters.” Well, why don’t you come over and suck on my sourdough starter dick, you fuck? [audience laughing] Are you kidding me? I didn’t bake. I didn’t do pop and fresh. I didn’t do',\n",
       "  ' toast. But with toast, then I would have to make eggs. If I made eggs, they’d have to be sunny side up. And you never make anything with the word sunny side in it during a pandemic. I didn’t sous vide. Oh yeah, everywhere throughout the country people were sous vide-ing. “I found a new way to cook meat.” Go fuck yourself. There were idiots in New York City who were smoking meats in their kitchen and lived to tell about it. [audience laughing] People became sushi Zen masters. Not me. I didn’t cook for myself and nobody, and I mean nobody, should cook for themselves ever. It’s the road to madness. Why? Fractions. [audience laughing] Yeah. Every recipe, every recipe in The Betty Crocker Cookbook is for a family, a happy family, of four. Not for one miserable prick. [audience laughing] What’s one quarter of one 16th of a teaspoon of cumin? That’s not a recipe for a meal. That’s a recipe for a fucking stroke. I did, um… The one thing I kind of made a commitment to, which I’d never really done before, but I really took this one. I said, yep… drinking. Yeah, I started to drink and I drank some more and then I drank a bit more. And then sometimes I drank more than that. Yes siree, and I wouldn’t start until seven o’clock. I showed some fucking discipline. But there were some days I pulled the blinds and went, “Fuck it.” I drank to forget. That’s why I drank. I drank to forget that I’d hadn’t become a sculptor or a gardener. I hadn’t bought a loom. I wasn’t making pot holders. I wasn’t making masks that on the side said, “My other mask is an N95.” I didn’t exercise, OK? I didn’t buy a Peloton because I had no kids to feed it. I didn’t… I didn’t, like many people, run in a marathon in my apartment. Who the fuck runs a marathon in their apartment?! Those people should be taken the fuck away. You’ve lost your fucking grip if you’re running a marathon in your apartment. “Oh, I was doing really well. Then I ran into the couch, in the 24 miles and goddammit I pulled a hammy. I’m gonna be out for weeks.” Shut up. [audience cheering] I thought I would read. That’s what I thought I would do. I really believed I would read. It was a perfect time for it. I had a lot of friends who were reading tons of books. Two, three, four books a week. Nothing but time. I thought, this is the real opportunity I’ve been waiting for. I’d read some really remarkable books. I’ve read some of the great books, and now all of a sudden I’ve found myself, fuck, this could be it. I could read Moby Dick finally. I tried a number of times, but only got to page eight. I said, “You know what? Fuck that white whale. I don’t give a shit. I’m not getting on that wooden fucking boat and going to sea. I’ll be vomiting by page 16.” Goddammit, and then I picked up the book and I tried to read it. I got to page three, and my brain said, “Drop the fucking book, you’re gonna die.” I thought… I thought that I would write a play, another play. You see, until I got into this, I was a playwright. I wrote plays until I was 40. And the reason I like to talk about this is ’cause I like to feel the interest of the audience leave the room. [audience laughing] Yeah. This reinforces my choice in a way. But I thought, “Goddammit, this would be a perfect time to write a play.” But no, no.. You see, I wrote plays for a long time. I wrote a lot of plays. I mean, a fucking lot of plays, to the interest of nobody. And I didn’t care. I loved doing it. I didn’t give a shit and I’d send them out and nothing. And I made practically nothing on this. I wasn’t making any money. You don’t make money as a playwright. And goddammit I thought, son of a bitch, the next one will do it, and it didn’t. So what I would’ve done really was kind of take a… a vow of poverty. I guess I wanted to be a priest, but keep fucking. [audience laughing] And I was getting just enough reinforcement. We’ve all had this in our lives, when we’re trying to follow a dream, and we kind of get reinforced to do something. Go, yeah, I’m almost there. And I kept thinking I’m getting closer and closer. And then finally a series of fucking musicals came to New York and I said, “I can’t write that shit.” Broadway was fucking awash in fucking nonsense. And the one that really drove me out of the theater is one that I know many of you love. It’s one of America’s most loved musicals. And it made me nuts. Cats. [audience laughs] That’s right, yeah, don’t fucking, some of you fucking like that, I know it. S',\n",
       "  'on of a bitch. Cats… I was… I had friends in the first production of Cats. They actually went on to become stars. “Are you coming to see the show?” Fuck you, you’re dressed up like a cat. [audience laughs] Unless you’re all doing some sort of a conga line in a litter box, I’m not coming. [audience laughs] I never saw Cats. I heard some of the music, but I never saw it. I couldn’t bring myself to go, but there was a production a number of years ago, just before the shit hit the fan that was really well worth– I wish I’d known, I would’ve gone. It was a performance of Cats, which was disrupted, when an audience member’s service dog got away… and began chasing one of the cat-costumed actors. [audience laughs] This is the first time one of the actual cats was involved in an incident with a dog. How good is that? It doesn’t get any better than that. Theater is– The best a theater can be, is when that fourth wall drops; When it disappears. It’s why at times, if something happens like the person whistling, or that the woman hooting in the back, I respond to it because there’s no fucking wall here. But theater pretends, and when it disappears… son of a bitch, the audience becomes a part of it. And when you’ve got a dog running around on stage, there’s nothing more exciting than to hear ♪ Memories… ♪ [barking like a dog] [laughter] [cheering and clapping] Oh yeah, I’d have paid… God, I’d have paid a couple of thousand dollars to see that fucking show. As time went on, I finally realized as I began to talk to my friends around the country, that there were places I could go where my friends had been doing the same thing I had. They were hunkered down, so that we could get together. I could visit people. And one of the things that made that possible, was if I wore a mask. This excited me to no end. But then there were many people– it turns out, who were really, really upset about masks. “Son of a bitch…” they would scream “…you’re taking away my freedom!” “No, I’m asking you to wear a mask.” Yeah, that’s it. It’s that simple, a mask. Why did I ask? Because you see, I have a… I’m a target for Covid. So if you’re not wearing a mask and you go… [phlegmy noises] There’s a good chance… I’m gonna fucking die! OK? So don’t tell me that, if I’m asking you to wear a mask, I’m taking away your freedom. If I ask you to put a ball gag in your mouth and then wear the mask… Then, I’m taking away your freedom. [laughter, cheers] OK? [cheers, applause] And I got… And if I was wearing a mask– I was in Florida a couple of months ago. If I’m wearing a mask, that doesn’t challenge anybody. But in Florida, where there was no pandemic, it really… it really was a challenge. People would look at me, if I was wearing a mask– and I’m serious… as if I had my penis wrapped around my neck. And, if I had my penis wrapped around my neck, I’ll tell you I wouldn’t be doing this shit for a living. [audience laughs] I did… The thing that, you know, that was fascinating was to learn that some people thought that health and freedom had something to do with each other. They don’t. Health and freedom are completely separate. And how do I know that? How do I know that they’re two different things? Because they’re spelt differently. I’ll tell you this, OK? There’s a, like, If I had not thought of this three weeks ago, and thought of this at the very beginning when people they were asking people to wear masks… I will tell you that what I should have done… I should have come up with a mask with a nipple in it. There isn’t… and I know there are folks out there because of your response to certain things, that the mask thing I said really bothered you. But I’m gonna tell you fuckers, if I put a nipple in that mask, you’d be sucking away right now. No kidding. If a nip– if you don’t find a nipple to be reason enough to put on a mask, you see a fucking psychiatrist, OK? On the list of shit that is wonderful in this world, nipples at least is number three. Goddammit! Everybody would be walking around. Nobody’d be listening to anybody. [slurping] I can’t hear you. And if I got liquid to go through that nipple, holy fuck, I’d be the President. [cheering, laughter] [applause] They… there’s a… they think we’re “going back to normal.” They keep saying that. I mean, is “going back to normal” having Steve Bannon in the White House, is that normal? Steve Bannon? Does that make sense? Steve Bannon, why would you have him at the White House? Why would you ',\n",
       "  'have him at the White House? OK? That I don’t understand because, I wouldn’t wanna look at Steve Bannon and not, but not on any kind of a– Steve Bannon looks exactly like how I feel when I’m hungover. [audience laughs] Would you put Kellyanne Conway back in the White House? Is that normal? Kellyanne Conway is somebody you choose to kill your daughter’s cheerleading rival. [audience laughs] We’ve gone back to, we’ve gone back to, really… We’re in abnormal… we tripled down on abnormal. We are so abnormal in certain ways, that we’ve made countries that used to look abnormal, look fucking normal. We’re going through really unusual times, really strange times. OK? The vaccine I… See… I that– The president, the… the leader, made… made– said that we were gonna have a vaccine at warp speed. And he did it. It was done. To his credit, that vaccine was created like fucking nobody’s business. I thought, that since he was a Republican, and there were… there was a lot of Republicans, that they would take the vaccine and a lot of them… [blows raspberry] didn’t. And I went, “Fuck, did I miss a day?” I was big on the vaccine. And the one of the reasons is ’cause: I didn’t wanna fucking die! And I was big on the vaccine because… My mother was my role model when it came to health. And my mother took every vaccine that came down the pike. Every single vaccination you could fucking have. My mother took it. One, after the other, after the other and… she’s now a hundred and three! [audience cheers] So… it wasn’t a tough decision for me. It’s what I thought, “Fuck, this is perfect. I’m gonna take the vaccine.” As a matter of fact, I would take– if my bathtub, instead of giving water had a vaccine in it, I’d be bathing every day. Uh-uh. But what I didn’t understand, was my…my generation. I didn’t understand how people my age didn’t take the vaccine. I didn’t get it. I could understand how other people might be skeptical. Not my generation. My generation, I thought, pretty much gets it. Because, my generation went through the greatest science experiment in the history of the country. My generation took the polio vaccine. My generation… [audience claps] and nobody knew what the fuck was gonna happen. Nobody. They took us out into the schoolyard, and had a giant hypodermic needle, and “Take this in the arm and if you don’t, you’re gonna lay on the ground and we’re gonna shove it up your ass.” [audience laughs] And that’s because our parents said, “Listen you little shit, you’re taking that shot whether you fucking like it or not.” [audience cheers, claps] And that’s it. Because we don’t wanna be watching television and listen to your fucking iron lung rattle in the background. [audience laughing] I didn’t understand what made Americans fear the vaccine so much. I never quite understood that. Where we advertise on television, pharmaceuticals. We advertise pharmaceuticals, and those ads must work, ’cause people are fucking buying those pharmaceuticals, and some of the fucking things that you can get, they’re telling you that you could get fucked by any one of these things. You don’t wanna be allergic to it, you could die. Boy, you might shit yourself out, and you’ll be living inside out. Your outsides will be out, your inside… [audience laughing] What? Are you fucking, people are buying it. And maybe the problem we have with vaccines is we didn’t advertise how shitty the reaction would be. You’re fucked. We should have told people, “Yeah, take that vaccine, it’s really gonna fuck you up, your eyes will cross.” Look, I can’t wait to get it! [audience laughing] In a goddamn country denying the fucking, “I’m not taking the vaccine.” But we buy $12 billion in supplements. What the fuck are we thinking? You gotta be kidding me. They’re supplements, you idiot. They’re not regulated. People put whatever the shit they want to in those capsules. Figure it the fuck out. [audience laughing] Goddammit. [audience applauding] It’s in a CVS. It’s in a Walmart, it’s in a goddamn Duane Reade. It’s sitting there. You… goddammit. “Oh boy. I’m taking these pills because Frank Amundsen and Doug Flutie, they took their pills, and they got bigger dicks now.” Are you kidding me? The fuck planet are you living on? [audience laughing] They’re sitting, the goddamn things, they’re sitting, these supplements are right next to Tampax’s. And if I covered a Tampax in chocolate, and tried to sell it as something that’d give you your hair back, peop',\n",
       "  'le would be fucking biting down. [audience laughing] We’re taking CBD oil like there’s no fucking tomorrow. No, and it’s not regulated. Some people have great CBD, and they really give a shit about it. But a lot of them don’t give a fuck. There are truck stops I’ve been to where they don’t even know how to spell CBD. [audience laughing] Goddammit. I’m surprised there are people who took, fucking comes from a weed that grows by the side of the road. I’m surprised we don’t see thousands of Americans on their hands and knees chewing that shit up. Goddammit. I’m taking a fucking supplement. It’s called Ashwagandha. That’s how hip I am. It’s an Indian herb, and it’s supposed to make you calm. That’s really fucking working out. [audience laughing, applauding] One thing that we… One thing that we really… got to deal with in this country, is we have to deal with the truly crazy people that walk amongst us. [audience laughing] We used to do that. If somebody did something crazy, we didn’t go, “Well, let’s try to understand that.” No! [audience laughing] No! We went, “Holy fuck. You’re gonna go have to sit there for a while in the tent with the white lab coat guy.” Yes, we did. And the reason we had to clear out the truly cray-crays is because the rest of us have real mental health issues. And if you don’t think you have a mental health issue after being alone on one level or another for the last fucking few years, something is wrong with you. [audience laughing] We all have the problem. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, OK? I had never experienced depression. I had never experienced anxiety. And then, goddammit, we have got to find a way so that we can deal with our problems and our children’s problems. All right? Because if you allow, look, to allow Q-Anon to run amok, they’re nuts, OK? And I don’t give a fuck if your cousin’s in Q-Anon and you don’t think he’s nuts. I’m not a psychiatrist, but I know cray-cray when I fucking see it. [audience laughing] I’m old enough. I get it. Goddammit. Pedophiles everywhere. There are pedophiles everywhere, they yell. That’s what these Q-Anon, son of a bitch, they’re out in Hollywood. They’re politicians. Fuck you! Goddammit, put that energy into finding real pedophiles. What are you wasting fucking time for? You gonna tell me Hillary Clinton is a pedophile? Are you fucking nuts? Hillary Clinton doesn’t want to have sex with children, Hillary Clinton doesn’t even want to have sex anymore. [audience laughing] And then, and this is when we could have got ’em, a bunch of them gathered down in Dealey Plaza. That was where they killed President Kennedy. And they said that, that they believed that John F. Kennedy Jr. was gonna come back. Now… [audience laughing] I don’t think when somebody comes back from the dead, they go to the place where their father’s killed. [audience laughing] So, I called him up to see, [audience laughing] and he said, “No, I’m not coming back. I’ve got, I’m coming in three weeks. That’s when my flying lesson is.” [audience groans] That’s worth the whole evening. [audience laughing] That… that’s what upsets you. And it’s good you have empathy. We don’t have empathy for live people, but fucking dead people, we’re right on it. [audience laughing] And he was coming back ’cause he was gonna meet up with Donald Trump. This is what they said. And then the two of them would go to the White House and kick out the Ghost of Christmas Past. [audience laughing] They were all there, there was a whole bunch of them there in Dealey Plaza. Just… there. And all we needed to do was fly over them and drop a net. [audience laughing] [audience applauding] In the end… I think what… I think what really got to me, and I think got to all of us in a way, was the lack of companionship. And companionship, you may have been with your family, but you weren’t out in the public square, you weren’t with people. And that makes a difference. Because otherwise you’re just staring at your phone, yelling at that prick who you don’t know. Sending out little things to tell them what an asshole they are. And that was a big problem. Because if you’re not with those people, you start to realize, you know, you get separated from them. I know that something was wrong with that separation. I know because I began to miss assholes. [audience laughing] Their presence. Not on the phone, I don’t need ’em on the phone, I need them right in front of me, saying something really fucking stupid. ',\n",
       "  '[audience laughing] And then we can talk about baseball teams we like. But you need assholes. Assholes make us better. Not on a screen, but when they’re there in the room. Fucking A. “Oh, boy,” you say, “I may be an asshole, but that’s a bigger asshole.” [audience laughing] And I was really, I was fucking, what fucked me up was a lack of companionship at that time. That sense of being amongst people. My friends, early on in the pandemic when I was losing my goddamn grip, said, “You know what you need? You need a cat.” [audience laughing] Those people are no longer my friends. [audience laughing] There’s something wrong with cats. There’s something wrong with cats. There’s something wrong with fucking cats. There’s something wrong with cats. And the only people who don’t know that there’s something wrong with cats, are people who own cats. [audience laughing] And they own cats because they don’t trust people. No, what they trust is a cat. And nobody should trust a cat, because these people have never looked in a cat’s eyes, and don’t you ever look in a cat’s eyes! I have. And a cat will try to suck your soul out. My soul is this big, and I got involved in a fight with a tomcat, that son of a bitch. What if he got my soul? What would that fucker do with it? I had to kick it in the mouth, that son of a bitch. If a cat weighed twenty pounds more, it would eat you, it would eat you, it would eat you. It would eat you. People who own cats say when it rubs up against me, it makes that purring sound. It’s telling me it loves me. No, it’s not, It’s telling you, “You may feed me, but soon I will feed on you.” Yes, siree, Bob. Oh, but it makes that pretty sound. That sounds, sounds like there’s a fucking engine inside. Sometimes I think that cats aren’t animals. They’re fucking machines. OK? They shit in a box. They shit in a box. They shit in a box. They shit in a box. A cat shits in a box. No other animal shits in a box. During the fall, do you ever see goddamn squirrel building a hut for himself to take a shit? No, you don’t. No, because the cat’s hiding in there to send the tapes they’ve been making of you back to the mothership, asshole. They’ve been tracking you. They’re the ones that control space lasers, not us Jews. [applause] So… I was asked a lot as I was sitting around I do these interviews, you know, “Boy, you’re not working. What, what do you miss the most about, you know, performing? Do you miss the laughter?” I said, “What? Laughter?” I said, “I do a lot of performing and… and… to no laughs. And I do a lot of times that I’ll hear laughter and no one is there.” Yes, siree, Bob. Yeah, no, I said, what I missed, and this is what I missed was my relationship with the audience. What I missed is the fact that I miss you. I missed my… but this is… This is really sad for you. This is sad what I’m gonna say. But it’s sad for you, it’s that you are my primary relationship. And you are, you’re the ones I talk to and you’ve given me a, you’ve, you’ve come out year after year after year, and I’m in front of you and you allow me to, to basically write in front of you. I’m writing in front of you. It takes a fucking idiot to do that. And it takes a group of people who are also idiots… to come out and give me that kind of freedom. It’s extraordinary to me. You’ve given me a gift that I will never be able to repay. And for that, I deeply thank all of you. [applause] And… [stammers] well, don’t, let’s not push it. [audience laughs] And so in the end, what I realized is, is that… I really… I really don’t like you. But tragically, I need you. So, please take care of each other and… and I love you. I can’t thank you enough. Good night. [audience applauds, cheers] [“Soul Road” by Floyd Kellogg plays] [cheers, applause continue] [music fades] Your email address will not be published.

       " ['“Louis C.K.: At The Dolby” is Louis C.K.’s third self-released stand-up comedy special since the pandemic, following his previous Grammy-winning and nominated specials. Filmed at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, CA in early January 2023, this special marks his 10th stand-up show and dives into his dark thought process, tackling topics such as different forms of confidence, America’s changing abortion laws, Biblical stories, divorce, and dealing with the death of parents. The special doesn’t directly address his past controversies from 2017, but instead, focuses on presenting his unique blend of humor. Memorable jokes include his lack of personal and moral confidence, modern-day slavery, and his interactions with a homeless man in New York City. He also humorously explores stories from the Bible, his fear of hell, and his Mexican heritage. From Louis CK’s presentation: “Louis CK: Live at The Dolby” includes a lot of the same material that was in “Back to The Garden” but it also has a bunch of stuff that wasn’t in that show, including a totally different closing chunk of jokes (as of the latest edit). And it is shot more carefully with more and better cameras and edited tightly. I like to think of it this way: “Back to the Garden” was the live concert and “Live at The Dolby” is the album.” * * * Thank you. [Clears throat] All right, hello, there. Hey! [Cheers and applause] [Laughing] Hey. Okay. All right. I’m gonna talk to you for about an hour. And it’s weird here. It’s weird, what I do. Somebody asked me once if it takes confidence to — Nobody asked me, but I just wanted to talk about this. If it takes… [Laughter] It does take confidence to do this. It takes a — not a general confidence, but a specific kind. You know? There’s lots of kinds of confidence. There’s personal confidence. I don’t have much of that. That’s… Personal confidence is like a man wearing white pants. That takes, you know… tremendous confidence and optimism, really… [Laughter] …to leave the house in white pants like it’s gonna be a great day. There’s gonna be no puddles or pizza, nothing. [Laughter] I could never wear white pants because I’ll get my period, first of all. I know that. [Laughter] Or diarrhea, more likely. [Laughter] Which is — That’s really my period. Diarrhea. About once a month, I’m like, “Oh, fuck, here we go.” [Laughter] “Better just get home. And don’t make any big decisions today.” [Laughter] It’s true. Don’t make — You know, if you have diarrhea, don’t, like, negotiate. It’s a bad bargaining position. If I have diarrhea, you stand between me and the toilet, I’ll sell you my house for 10 cents. [Laughter] So that’s one kind of confidence. Here’s another kind — moral confidence. Moral confidence. That means knowing that you would do the right thing, knowing that you wouldn’t do something wrong. Moral confidence. You can have that in your daily life because a lot of your days are the same. But what if you were in another time? Like, I would love to believe, I feel confident that I would not have had slaves. I wouldn’t have done it. I wouldn’t have done it. I wouldn’t have had any. Even if I lived in 17-whatever in Virginia and all my neighbors had slaves, I would have been like, “You guys are dicks.” [Laughter] I can say that. But it’s easy to say that now because you can’t get no slaves. You just can’t — You can’t get any. That’s why you don’t have slaves. It’s not because you’re better than back-then people. It’s because they’re not available. That’s a huge contributing factor. It’s not a decision you need to make every day, like you’re carrying your groceries. “Ah, fuck. Maybe I should — No, no, I better not. But, geez, it would be easier.” [Laughter] Because they’re not there. It’s not like they have slaves at Home Depot. I mean, they kind of do, but, yeah… [Laughter] …there are some forms of kind of slavery. You can get a Russian woman to do whatever you want because her family’s hostage. That’s one of them. But that’s still temporary. I mean, you could — You could adopt, like, a 12-year-old from Bangladesh and… [Laughter] I mean, really. He’ll move into your house and do your laundry and suck your dick, whatever you want. But even he gets to leave when he’s 18. [Laughter] Although who wants them when th',\n",
       "  'ey’re that old? I’m just saying. Excuse me. I’m just saying… [Laughter] …that slavery gets rebranded, but it doesn’t really ever totally go away. I mean, it’s been part of human history going way back, way back, slavery. Even the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia… I don’t know. I didn’t go to college. I don’t know anything. But the earliest images of human life already had the guys going, “Uhh!” and the guy going, “Ahh! [Muttering]” How early did we come up with this? Like, from the beginning of human existence, we evolved, you know, through ideas. We were a scared, naked ape, and then we were like, “Make a fire. That’s a good idea. Kill an animal and take his fur. That’s a good idea. Plant things and then wait. That’s a good idea.” But really quickly we came up with, “Just make them fucking do it. I’m not doing anything. I’m doing nothing. Make them fucking do it.” [Laughter] That was, like, our third thing we did on Earth. [Laughter] So, you can have confidence, but you got to be a little, you know. I mean, there’s things that people did in history that I wouldn’t have done for sure. Like, I wouldn’t have made an Auschwitz. I wouldn’t have done that. What am I gonna do with an Auschwitz? [Laughter] Yeah, Auschwitz is not one of those where you’re like, “It was the times, you know?” It was… [Laughter] It was a horrible thing. Obviously, Auschwitz — horrible. They killed people. They killed children. They killed little children in Auschwitz who could have grown up and moved to Brooklyn and hated black people, and they didn’t get to do that. [Laughter] It’s terrible. I know. I had a friend who’s a comedian in England, and he made a joke about Auschwitz. And he got in a lot of trouble. It was a big shitstorm. And at one point, Auschwitz tweeted… [Laughter] …about his joke. It’s true. It said, “Auschwitz” with a blue check. So it was like, “Oh, cool. It’s really them,” you know? [Laughter] And they tweeted like, “That’s not funny.” [Laughter] Why is the death camp tweeting? [Laughter] Who’s running the social accounts at Auschwitz? “I got a summer job at Auschwitz. I’m running their Twitter.” [Laughter] Moral confidence. There’s other ways to boost your moral confidence. Like, you can do good things. Or, you know — or not. You can… [Laughter] You can help people all the time. You can help homeless people. There’s a lot of homeless people here. There’s a shitload of homeless people here. I mean, not in here. There’s none in here. [Laughs] There’s zero in here. That’s right. They can’t come in here. [Laughter] Even with a ticket, they cannot come in here. They’re not allowed in the places where we’re allowed. That’s what we all agree on. Everybody is like, “I don’t know what to do about the homeless, but they’re not coming in here. They’re not coming in here. They’re outdoor people. They don’t have…” [Laughter] If you don’t have your own indoors, you can’t go in other people’s indoors. [Laughter] They can’t go where we go. There’s places where you’ll never see a homeless person, like the airport. There’s no homeless people at the airport. You go to the bus station, they’re on the bus beside you. But at the airport, they can’t even get to it. They can’t even get to it. You’ve never seen a homeless person in the airport. You’ve never been at your gate, and some guy’s like, “Hey, man. Trying to get to Tokyo. Can you help me out? [Laughter] Can you give me an aisle seat, brother?” [Laughter] And they’re all over the country. Everywhere now. I’ve been on tour. I’ve seen them everywhere. I was in Phoenix, and it was during the summer. 120 degrees. And homeless people are just standing at the intersection with a sign, and they’re just [Imitates sizzling] They’re just cooking. You can’t even tell what race he was before it burnt off. [Laughter] And he’s holding a sign that says, “Help. I’m on fire.” [Laughter] But you, you’re, like — You’re in a white BMW, like, “I-I… I can’t. Sorry. There’s glass here. I can’t help because of the glass.” [Laughter] And even here, you drive by them. In New York, you walk right by them. So in New York, they’re right there. They’re in your space, they’re in your world. And you got to make a choice. Every couple of blocks, you got to make a choice. You can help or not. You g',\n",
       "  'ot to keep shooting it. You got to put a limit on it somewhere because you’re not gonna help all of them and you’re not gonna help any of them, really… with a few bucks. But there’s always that — Like, there’s a homeless guy who lives — He doesn’t live anywhere, but, I mean, he’s… By definition, he’s at large. [Laughter] But he’s often seen. [Laughter] He’s always on the corner by my house. Same guy every day. And I walk past him every day on the way to the store. I go to the same store every day. I go to Claire’s. I don’t know if you know Claire’s. It’s a jewelry store for children. [Laughter] I go there every day. I buy a handful of scrunchies, and I run home. Everything else, I buy online. [Laughter] Anyway, when I walk by this homeless guy in the morning, he always goes, “Hey, man, can you help me out?” And I go, “Sure.” I give him 5 bucks, and I go to the store. Five minutes later, I walk by, and he says, “Hey, man. Can I –” He doesn’t remember, which is fine, but I don’t want to give him another 5 bucks, you know, because I only have a few million. I don’t know why. I don’t know why. I clearly should. [Laughter] I don’t know what makes me go, “Mm-hmm-hmm. You had your $5, young man.” [Laughter] What? Am I gonna spoil him? [Laughter] You know what I was thinking about today? I was thinking about Jesus. [Laughter] I was. Today. I was thinking about Jesus. And after I came… [Laughter] …I… I thought, “Well, I feel sorry for Jesus.” That’s how I feel. I don’t know how much you know about Jesus, but I feel fucking bad for Jesus, man. I do. He had a hard life. I mean, the last day was particularly difficult, but… [Laughter] If you look at pictures of him, he had to wear that — that thong, that fucking just dishrag yanked up his balls. Just [Groans] carrying his cross like, “Fuck. It’s the rash.” [Laughter] Some people say you should live like Jesus. Who can live — He was insane. [Muttering] You can’t live like that. He had a weird life. I’m reading about Jesus. I have this book about Jesus. [Laughter] I’m gonna share it with you. [Cheers and applause] Okay. This is a book about Jesus. Actually, only this much is about Jesus. Only that — just that part. The rest of it is just the Jews going like, “And then we walked for 50 years in the desert. And we only had a little bit of oil. It was difficult.” It’s just… It’s fucking verbose. Just Jews. It just goes on and on. “And then Jacob bought a goat, and… [Laughter] And Abraham lived to be 800.” Yeah, I bet he fucking did, too. [Laughter] The Jews in the early chapters are all, like, 800 years old. And then God was like, “I can’t live with these fucking Jews for 800 years. Heart disease starts today.” [Laughter] So that’s them. And that’s Jesus. This little part’s Jesus. And the weird part is, it’s not all — Like, it’s all the same story over and over again. They tell the same story about Jesus’ life over. First Matthew tells it, and then Mark is like, “Dude, that’s not what — You’re fucking drunk. Here’s what happened. [Laughter] I’ll tell you what happened. Hey, Paul. You weren’t even here. Shut the fuck up.” [Laughter] And I started reading it because I never read it. I was raised Catholic. But they don’t encourage you to read, the church. They don’t. They don’t want you to read this. You know? Jews read this shit in Hebrew, and Baptists sit down, and they read together. But the Catholics, they want you to come in the building. They want you to come in, and they tell you. And you’re like, “Can I read it?” They’re like, “No, I’ll tell you what happened. Sorry. Put the book down.” [Laughter] But it’s interesting because when you read the stories, you know, you think of them as lofty, kind of, like, but some of them are just basic life in Jesus’ life. Okay, here’s one. This is when he turned water into wine. This is his first miracle. This is John Chapter 2. Okay? Okay. “And on the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called and his disciples to the wedding. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, ‘They have no wine here.’ [Laughter] And Jesus saith unto her, “Woman, What have I to do with thee?” [Laughter] Just life. Mary was a fucking alcoholic. [Laughter] He to',\n",
       "  \"ok her to a wedding. “There’s no fucking wine, Jesus! What am I supposed to do here without wine?!” [Laughter] And he’s like, “Mom! Don’t!” [Laughter] Anyway, you know, the rest of the story is that Jesus, he’s at the wedding. They had no wine. The guy — So Jesus went to the guy running the wedding, and he was like, “Look in the water barrel.” Like that. Like a closeup magician. “Why don’t you take a look?” [Laughter] “Maybe it’s not the Red Queen. Go ahead. Flip that card over. What do you think?” Told him to look in the water barrel, and he looked, and it was wine. He had turned all their water into wine. Everybody rejoiced. Except the guy running the wedding was probably like, “We did need some water.” [Laughter] “It’s actually a bigger problem.” [Laughter] I have a feeling a lot of his miracles were met with mixed… Like, “Oh. Thanks. That’s great, Jesus. Fuck.” [Laughter] Like, Lazarus. Lazarus had been dead for four days, and Jesus comes to town, and he says, “Lazarus, rise,” and Lazarus comes out of the tomb like [Groans, coughs]. And Lazarus’ wife is like, “Are you fucking kidding me right now?” [Laughter] But so, here’s a story that I want you to — I want to read to you. This story, I’ve never seen it in a Jesus movie. This story is not in any movies about Jesus. And it’s not — I never — I never — Until I sat and read this, I never heard this story… ’cause it’s weird. This is the story of Jesus cursing a fig tree. Does anybody by applause know of this story? [Light applause] Okay. That’s just enough to make it clear this is true. I mean, it’s not — Nothing’s true in here. But… I’m just kidding. I’m just kidding. I don’t fucking know. What do I know? I wasn’t there. I’m just trying to make it clear that I didn’t make it up. [Laughter] They did. But, anyway, all right, I don’t know. Okay, here’s the story. This is Mark Chapter 11. It’s when Mark went broke. [Laughter] Okay. “And Jesus entered into Jerusalem. And when he had looked around about and seen all things and the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the 12.” Bethany was like a — like a suburb of Jerusalem. So he went in Jerusalem. You know, you see all the shit downtown, but you don’t stay downtown. You go to the Marriott by the airport, you know? That’s what Bethany was. Okay? “And on the morrow when they’d come from Bethany, Jesus was hungry, and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to it, if haply he might find anything thereon. But when he came to the tree, he found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs was not yet. [Laughter] And Jesus answered and saith unto the tree, ‘No man shall eat fruit of thee hereafter and forever.’ [Laughter] And the disciples heard it. And in the morning when they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and dead. And Peter, calling to remembrance, saith unto him, ‘Master, behold the fig tree which thou dost cursedst has withered away and died.’ And Jesus answered and saith unto them, ‘Have faith in God.'” [Laughter] What the fuck kind of a Jesus story is that? [Laughter] “Hey, Jesus. You killed the tree.” “That’s right, motherfucker.” [Laughter] What’s the fucking point to this story? What is the moral? Jesus just killed a tree. He was hungry. He was fucking cranky. He was like, “There’s no figs? Fuck you, tree. You’re fucking dead, you piece of shit. I wanted a fig. You’re fucking dead. Watch this.” And the tree’s like, “But the time of figs is not yet. I just — It’s just not yet. I need another week. You want fruit out of season, go to Whole Foods, you fucking Jew. I didn’t do anything.” [Laughter, applause] You can’t act like that, man. You can’t act like that. You walk around acting like that, folks will nail you to a cross. That’s what they’ll do. They will. You got to fucking cool it, Jesus. [Laughter] He got a little, you know. That’s really what happened. He got a little shitty. A little big, you know. He went to Jerusalem. That’s a big town for a boy from Galilee. And he didn’t just walk into Jerusalem. He walked in, and his friends were like, “King of the Jews, y’all! King of the motherfucking Jews!” [Laughter] The Jews didn’t like that. The Jews were like, “Not my president. Whatever,” you know. [Laughter] So they nailed him to a cross. This is w\",\n",
       "  'hat they did. And this — The weirdest thing to me about Catholicism and all Christianity is, this image — This image is the image of the biggest, most powerful religion. The cleanest religion. And it’s a fucking dead guy with nails just, ugh, just blood. And it’s in every polite room in the world. Every nice, quiet place, there’s a fucking Jesus. And the president and his wife, and they wear pearls, and then we always go to look at the fucking… It’s just weird ’cause it promotes nicely ideas, like honor thy mother and thy father, ’cause they die! Aah! It’s just macabre. [Laughter] But I love it. I love the image. I love it. I was raised Catholic my whole life. I loved this image. I’d stare at it. Every time I go by a church, if it’s open, I go in ’cause I want to see their Jesus. They all have a different Jesus. They’re a little different. Some of them, he’s really suffering. And some of them, he’s just like, “[Clicks tongue] Oh, well. [Chuckles] I really got myself in a noodle this time, boy.” [Laughter] Sometimes there’s just a cross, like, “Oh, fuck. Where’d he go? Jesus got away.” [Laughter] But they’re all different. I was in a Korean church, and I saw a Korean Jesus. They had a Korean Jesus with the… [Laughter] Don’t get mad. How else would I know? It was just — They were cringes. Uhh! Whatever. Whatever. [Laughter] Jesus looks different everywhere. Mostly Jesus has blond hair and blue eyes, which we know he didn’t have, but that’s who won everything, so they get to draw him. The truth is, Jesus was black. But you don’t see that often, black Jesus. “Hey, man. Get me the fuck down from here.” Whatever, all right. [Laughter] But everybody wants Jesus to look like them, so they make him — They draw him to look like them. That’s why I don’t like that he’s always skinny. Jesus is always rail thin, just fucking “Mm!” “I’ve been doing Pilates for months getting ready for this.” It’s not fair. You never see a fat Jesus. I never one time saw, like, just a fat Jesus… [Laughter] …with, like, ten nails in each hand. [Laughter] He might have been fat. We don’t know. I’ll tell you what Jesus was not, is Korean. [Laughter] There’s no Koreans in Jerusalem in the year one. [Laughter] But I was raised Catholic, and I ended up walking away from that ’cause I didn’t like it. You know why? ‘Cause they tell you you’re going to hell. And they tell little kids that. You’re 5 years old, and the church, with all its majesty and all the buildings and the clothes, they go up to a 5-year-old, and they’re like, “Oh, you’re going to hell. Oh, yeah. You’re going right to hell.” And you’re 5, and you’re like, “What did I do?” And the church is like, “You know what you did, you piece of shit.” [Laughter] And you’re going to full hell, too. There’s no kids’ hell, you understand? You’re going right to the show. If you’re 5 years old, you steal a crayon from your sister, and then you lie about it, you get hit by a truck, you’re roommates with Hitler. There’s no difference. There’s no difference. They take you in a room, and they’re pouring hot lead into Hitler’s asshole. He’s like, “Aaaahhh!” Nein!” And then you walk in. They’re like, “All right, step up. It’s your turn.” [Laughter] Hitler’s like, “Oh! Good luck, little fella.” [Laughter] [Laughs] Poor Hitler, man. I mean, at this point, he’s been down there for 75 years. He’s probably nice now. [Laughter] Hitler’s probably nice to newcomers in hell, you know? “Hi! Yeah. Yeah, it’s pretty bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What’s that? Oh, yeah. Okay.” [Laughter, applause] I was so scared of hell when I was a kid. I remember when I found out that gay people go to hell, according to the church, and I got scared ’cause I’m not gay, but what if God thinks I’m gay? [Laughter] What if I come off a little queer to the Lord? [Laughter] What if he happens to glance at me when I hit my toe and I’m like, “Ow!”? He’s like, “Oh, I know where you’re going, you f*ggot.” [Laughter] I mean, that’s their thing. I don’t believe that. God doesn’t hate you ’cause you’re gay. God made you gay ’cause he hates you. [Laughs] No. I’m just kidding. I’m kidding. There’s no God. [Laughter] But you know who I feel sorry for? Who I really feel sorry for is a gay man’s sperm. Just think about that. That’s a tough desti',\n",
       "  'ny. [Laughter] Being a sperm inside of a gay man, that’s hard luck. ‘Cause if you’re gay, that’s great. But your sperm is not gay. Your sperm is just excited, like, “We’re next, fellas. Here we go.” [Laughter] [Imitates rocket lift-off] [Laughter] [Laughter continues] “Is that shit right there?” [Laughter] “Who shit in this chick’s pussy?” [Laughter] Now… I was thinking about my life today. I was thinking about, like, when I grew up, and…. I was raised in an orphanage about a block from my parents’ house. And… [Laughter] It’s a joke. My father is Mexican. And my — Whoo-hoo! Mm-hmm. [Cheers and applause] Yes. Six of you here. [Laughter] My father’s Mexican, my mother is dead, so I’m half dead on my mom’s side, and I’m half Mexican. A lot of people don’t believe I’m Mexican. When I tell them I’m Mexican, they say stupid things. They say things like, “How can you look like that?” What do you mean, “how”? Like, I’m trying to, like, “Look, I’m not Mexican. No. I’m not Mexican at all.” Then I get a home, like, “Señor.” [Laughter] My parents, they got divorced when I was about 10. And I have kids now, and their parents are divorced, also. And… …I remember when we told our kids about that we were gonna divorce. If you get divorced, you should tell your children. [Laughter] So we had to do it carefully ’cause they were 5 and 2 years old at the time. So we had to put it in a way that they could comprehend. So I remember we sat them down. And I said, “Okay, listen, you know how you love your dog? You love your dog. Like, sometimes you give your dog food from your plate. You’re not supposed to, but you do that ’cause you love your dog. Remember the other day your mom and I were like, ‘Don’t give the dog any ham,’ but you did ’cause you love your dog? Okay, so that’s why we’re getting a divorce. [Laughter] Because you don’t listen. [Laughter] And we just can’t take it anymore. It’s just too hard to not be listened to. So we’re gonna move to separate homes and each have you for half the week ’cause neither of us wants to have you all the time anymore. [Laughter] Yeah, and it’s very sad because I love your mother very, very much. And she loves me so much. But we hate you more.” [Laughter] That’s how we handled it. You do your best, you know? That’s all you can do with your kids. Do your best. Nobody fucking knows right from wrong. When I was a kid, they just taught us things to just try to keep us to just shut the fuck up. Our morals were just, “Shut the fuck up.” [Laughter] Things like “slow and steady wins the race.” They taught us that. “Slow and steady wins the race.” Really? Does it win the race? [Laughter] You know what beats slow and steady? Fast and steady kicks the shit out of slow and steady. Slow and steady beats old and retarded. That’s about it. Stop telling that to kids. [Laughter] A lot of what they teach kids is just to make them polite people. You know? Like, they teach them that there’s words you shouldn’t use. There’s bad words. Don’t use the bad words. I can’t teach my kids that because I do this for a living. But I didn’t want my kids to be, you know, assholes. So I used to tell them, like, “Okay, look, there’s no bad words. There’s no bad words. All words are good, bad, nothing. But there’s some people that get upset when you use certain words. So if you’re gonna use those words, look at the person first and try to guess if they’re that kind of person.” [Laughter] Sometimes you can offend somebody when you weren’t even trying to. Like, there’s certain — certain phrases, certain statements that if you’re gonna say them, you should say them without stopping in the middle. Certain things, if you’re gonna say them, don’t clear your throat in the middle. Okay? You don’t want to say things like, There are too many black people… [Clears throat] suffering from discrimination.” [Laughter] “We need to stop the Jews… [Clears throat] from feeling excluded.” [Laughter] “I once fucked a baby… [Clears throat] and then I fucked him again.” [Laughs] [Laughter] No. So you want to get through that one. Otherwise, people get the wrong idea. They’ll think you only fucked that baby once. [Laughter] But it’s tricky, you know. If you’re trying to teach your kids right from wrong, you got to choose a side often be',\n",
       "  'cause not everybody agrees on what’s right and wrong. So how do you know? You know? Like abortion. Some people think it’s murder. Some people don’t. I personally — I think people should get abortions, like, a lot. Like, as many as you can. You should try to get a lot of abortions. You know why? ‘Cause it creates jobs. More abortions, more jobs for the doctors and the nurses and the Dumpster guy. Everybody gets a job. They have to work. How are they gonna feed their kids if you don’t kill yours? It’s a whole — It’s — You got to think of everybody. [Laughter] Abortion is a big topic, of course, because Roe v. Wade was overturned. Roe vs. Wade. Of course, we all know what this is. This was a court case. Roe was a woman who wanted an abortion, and Wade was the baby, I guess. I don’t know. [Laughter] I don’t know. I’m just assuming. I never found out who Wade was. Wade must have been the baby. Anyway… [Laughter] But now that we don’t have that, every state has to come up with their own law based on how people feel. They have to listen to people and see how they feel. I think most Americans feel on average the same thing about abortion. They feel like people should be able to get abortions if they need them, but, you know, just, uh, keep it down a little bit. That’s all. Just… Just go ahead, but, you know, come on, come on. You know, do it, but don’t be like, “Whoo-hoo-hoo!” Like, just, you know. [Laughter] So we need a law that covers that, that keeps it available, but limits it. Here’s what I think we should do. Let’s make this law. You can get an abortion anytime, anywhere. But if you get an abortion, you have to eat it. I think that’s fair. Because that’ll keep it — That’ll make you, “Hmm. Fuck. I gotta eat it? [Laughter] [Sighs] I better do it soon.” [Laughter] [Cheers and applause] Just trying to make everybody happy, you know? [Laughter] Some — Some Catholics believe that contraception is murder. They think if you wear a condom, if you stop a sperm from getting to an egg, you killed a possible baby. By that logic, I could say that any woman that won’t fuck me is a murderer. [Laughter] Let me tell you, there’s a bunch of murdering bitches out there. But… …murder is a weird law structure. Also, that is not a sentence. Didn’t make any sense, but… murder should be simple because it’s a binary crime. You kill somebody, or you don’t. They’re alive, or they’re dead. It’s one or the other. But — But the laws around murder are a little murky. One person could kill somebody, get 100 years. Somebody else gets 20. Why? What’s the difference? Here’s what they base your sentence on with murder. They base it on how you felt when you murdered them. That’s weirdly important. They say, “Okay, you shot him in the face. But what was up with you, man? Like, what was going on? [Laughter] Like, come on.” I think if you murder somebody, your sentence should be based on how old the person was that you murdered. That should matter. How much of their life did you take away? Like, if you see a 3-year-old girl in the park, and you just kick her to death… [Laughter] [Sighs] It’s a hypothetical. Fucking grow up. It’s a hypothetical. I’m not asking you to go do that. I’m just asking you to just really imagine just kicking a 3-year-old till she’s dead. [Laughter] All right. If you kill a 3-year-old, you should do a lot of time. You should do a lot of time. Unless she’s got, like, diabetes. You got to work it all in. But… But what if… What if you kill somebody who’s, like, 98? He’s 98, and he’s, like, in a hospice. He’s not even good 98. He’s in hosp– You know what hospice is? It’s like a hospital where they don’t try to help you. [Laughter] And say there’s a guy, and he’s, like, 98 in a hospice. He’s got — He’s got cancer and AIDS and COVID. [Laughter] And he’s like [Groans] And they just unplugged him. He’s [Groans] And right then, you walk in… [Imitates gunshots] [Laughter] …shoot him right in the face. You should get, like, five minutes for that. [Laughter] I was thinking about that today. I was. ‘Cause I’m going to see my dad next week. And my dad — Let me tell you something. Okay? My father is not in a hospice. My dad is in a facility being kept alive. For whose benefit? I don’t get it. It’s just he’s [Groans] And they jus',\n",
       "  't put food in and pbht and just… “Come on! Keep going!” Like, what does he have — a secret he hasn’t told yet? [Laughter] ‘Cause, look, my mom just died. She just died. That’s how it works. By the way, for you young people, here’s how life goes. One of your parents is gonna die, and the other one is just never gonna fucking die. [Laughter] They just will never fucking die. Ever. And guess what. It’s not the one you wanted. [Laughter] Nope. It’s not the one you wish to have kept. It’s not your good parent. Nobody’s got two good parents. You have a nice one and a shitty one. And the nice one just dies ’cause that’s what nice people do. “I’ll just die. I don’t want to bother everybody.” [Laughter] And the shitty one just hangs in there. [Coughs] [Wheezing] “Oh, shit. Another day of this.” Why? What the fuck for, the long life? You can live too long, I think. You can live too long. Some people are 100. Get the fuck out of here. [Laughter] Nobody knows you. [Laughter] What, are you gonna run into somebody? “Hey!” [Laughter] Some people are even older. Some people are — You ever read about the oldest person in the world? There’s always an oldest person. And sometimes you read about them because the other one just died. That’s when they tell you that there’s a new oldest person. Last one I read about was 114. 114. He’s a teenager after 100. [Laughter] You know what that means? That means he’s got a kid who’s like, 92… who’s like, “Please fucking die. [Laughter] I’m just hanging around so I can have one week without you in it.” [Laughter] I mean, here’s the bad news — You’re gonna die. Here’s the good news — When you get closer, you’re gonna want to fucking die. It doesn’t keep being good. You don’t get to keep your life the way it is. Like, I’m 55. Both hands hurt. Both hands. Both my hips hurt. I’m lucky I have only one asshole. The whole fucking body hurts. When you’re, like, in your 30s, you don’t even think about it. You’re like — ‘Cause here’s, like — There’s the beginning of your life, and there’s the end. So, like, you start, like, in your 3– Like, you’re in your 30s. You’re just shuffling. You’re not even aware of this movement. You’re just shuffling along. “Hey. Life is good. Pretty cool.” And then somewhere you’re kind of aware that way down there, people are — “Aah!” — falling off the edge. “Aah!” “Oh. Yeah. Weird.” [Laughter] And then you’re not thinking. Then all of a sudden, you’re close, and you’re, “Aah! Oh, fuck, I knew that guy. Oh, my God. Holy shit.” [Laughter] But there are signs that your time is coming to an end, you know? Like — Like they don’t make my shampoo anymore. They don’t make it. It’s like, why’d you stop? Like, you’re the only one. Nobody fucking cares about you. [Laughter] And so I thought, I’m like, “I’m gonna make my own. I’m gonna make my own shampoo. I’m gonna look it up online. I’m gonna look at the ingredients. I’m gonna make my own.” And I found myself at a dinner telling a table full of people, “So I decided to make my own shampoo.” [Laughter] That’s one of those moments where you tell yourself, “Just don’t tell folks anything. You don’t need to say it out loud. Just do what you’re doing. Die as soon as possible.” [Laughter] Do I have a huge stain? Yeah, that’s all right. It’s all right. So what? Okay. No, no, no. Who’s running? Oh, okay. I thought they were coming to bring me something. There’s nothing you can do. You’d have to change my whole lifestyle for the rest of the show. [Laughter] It doesn’t — It doesn’t matter. I’m fat. I’m fat. I’m a fat guy. I’m fat. I’m fat. I — My pronouns are “that fat fuck” and… [Laughter] But here’s the thing. I have body dysmorphia. I think I look good. I like this. I’m fine with it. I decided to stop exercising. That’s what I decided this year. I’m just not doing it anymore. I made it to 55. If I stop exercising now, it just means I might make 75 instead of 78. It’s not that big a fucking deal. I’m just not gonna do it. You know, who inspired me was Trump. It’s the one thing he said that I liked. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard this, but Trump believes — He just believes. Nobody told him this. But he believes that you should move as little as possible because you have a finite amount of movements and then you just — You st',\n",
       "  'op. He believes that. He just went, “Yeah, that sounds right.” And he just thought it up. And he’s proving it to be true. I mean, it’s fucking working. I don’t like the new exercise either. I don’t like the Peloton, you know? It’s a bike you ride, and there’s a video that encourages you. And they have that mirror that you stand there, and it teaches you exercises. Then they have that gun you put in your mouth, and you fucking… [Laughter] Nah. No, you shouldn’t kill yourself. [Laughter] That’s what I think. You should not kill yourself. That’s my opinion. I don’t know you. Ask somebody that knows you. [Laughter] But my general feeling is, you shouldn’t kill yourself. You know why? ‘Cause you’re gonna die anyway. You’re gonna die. What are you getting violent for? It’s gonna happen. “I wish I was dead.” You will be. Just sit there. You don’t have to do anything. [Laughter] It really is the most effective argument against suicide, is that you’re gonna die either way. It also happens to be the best argument for suicide, which is awkward. Go ahead. You’re gonna die if you don’t. [Laughter] Anyway… a friend of mine sent me a porn the other day. Folks can just send you pornography now. It was a porn. It was two old men. Like, really old guys, really old. And they were sucking each other’s cocks. Like, really sucking each other’s cocks. They were so old. I was surprised they were doing anything. But there they were. One of them is, like, sitting on the edge of a bed, and his socks have fallen, you know. [Laughter] And the other guy is on his knees on a pillow. And he’s just fucking blowing the guy. Then they switch places. I watched long enough to see them switch places. [Laughter] And when the second guy was done, I called my friend and said, “Why did you send me this?” He said, “Because it’s amazing.” And it really was, you know? It really was. I’ve watched it a few times because it doesn’t turn me on. It’s inspiring. ‘Cause you’re like, “Go, fellas!” ‘Cause you worry about old guys. You know, you see an old man walking by himself with just a grapefruit in a plastic bag, you know? You’re like, “Ah, shit, that’s horrible.” Maybe he’s going to suck another guy’s cock. Life might be better than you think. [Laughter] It’s interesting ’cause porn used to be like, you go find your thing, you know. But now you go to a porn site. It’s everybody’s stuff. You can put in a search word to narrow it down, or you can look around, find new things. I saw a fart porn one time. So fart porn. I never thought I’d be turned on by farts. I’m not interested in farts. Farts are okay. I’m farting right now. I’ve been farting this whole time. [Laughter] And I didn’t want to watch it ’cause it was a fart porn. It was ’cause of the title. The title is what got me. The title was “Nice Girl Farts in Your Face.” [Laughter] Who’s not gonna watch that? “Nice Girl Farts in Your Face.” So I click on it. And there’s this girl standing there. I’m like, “She is nice. She’s totally nice.” Just a nice girl standing there. Pink sweater with little blue buttons on it. And she’s looking in the camera, and she says, “Hi. I’m so glad to see you.” I was like, “Wow.” She made me feel good, you know? And then she turns around like she’s reaching. She goes, “I got to show you something, like, I bought,” And she’s reaching up, and all of a sudden, pbht! And I was like, “Oh, my God!” I mean, it was in the title. I knew it was gonna happen. But I was like, “Oh, my God!” She just farted right in my face. She seemed so nice. [Laughter] But the best part is when she — her reaction ’cause I thought she would be like, “That’s right. I farted in your face.” But she wasn’t. She was like, “[Gasps] Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am so sorry. I can’t believe that happened.” I’ve never been that hard in my entire life. I was so excited. [Laughter] ‘Cause I realized it’s not really about the fart. It’s about the shame. It’s about the sexy shame of a truly nice girl who just thunder farted right in your face, and she regrets it. [Laughter] Here’s the worst part. I can’t find one that good again. I can’t. They’re never that good. I’ve been chasing the dragon on this fart porn for months. It’s just always some bored chick. “Hello.” Pbht! Like, come on. Tighten it up, would',\n",
       "  ' you? A little bit. [Laughter] I have been dating recently. Dating is not fun. Dating’s horrible. Nobody wants to date. Even if you meet somebody and you really want to go out with them and they say yes, you’re excited in that moment, but the day of the date, you’re like, “I don’t want to fucking do this. I don’t want to do this.” Every time I’m ringing a doorbell to pick a woman up, I’m like, “I hope she’s dead in there. I really do. I hope something awful happened.” I don’t want to sit in a place and breathe unevenly for three hours and just sweating where your body. is folded and just, “Uh-huh.” [Laughter] Do you ever have a date that goes well? It’s, like, good from the beginning. You’re like — You get a little laugh at the beginning. “Hi. Ha ha.” Something funny. And they both laugh. Feels good. You see you agree on stuff. When you don’t agree, you laugh about it. You’re even able to be quiet a little bit while you’re eating, and it’s nice, feels comfortable. And then you drop them off. You’re like, “I hope I see you again.” And she says, “I hope so, too.” And you feel like, “This is something new in my life. This is wonderful.” Then you go home. And your wife is like, “Where were you all night?” You know, and you’re just fucking…. [Laughter] But… But I’m older now. I’m divorced, and I still date mostly women who are younger than me recently ’cause that’s who looks better. [Laughs] No, no. No, it’s true. But I’m not — I don’t like having — I’ve always been with women my age or older. I was married to a woman a year older than me for ten years. And that’s always been the way I’ve been. But, you know, there’s some guys that have to be with a younger woman. There’s — There’s cultures that believe the man should be much older. Like, there’s religions that have, like, a formula, you know? Like take the man’s age and subtract ten, and then whatever else you have to do to get to 12. Just get to… Just — Just solve for 12. [Laughter] But I didn’t suddenly get interested in younger women. What happened was, I got older, and they got interested in me ’cause the younger women, like older guys. They just do. That’s the other part nobody says. I don’t do anything to get younger women. I just stand there like this, and they see me, and they’re like, “That would be so weird to fuck that old guy.” [Laughter] And then we get blamed. The older guy always gets blamed. You see an older man with a young woman. Everybody’s like, “That guy’s a pervert.” No, she’s a pervert. He’s normal. He likes pretty women. She likes that. [Laughter] The fuck is wrong with her? And they’re weird. I was having sex with this woman, and she was about 35. And we’re in bed. She starts calling me “daddy.” I was like, “Please don’t, young lady. Please don’t do that.” She said, “Why does it make you uncomfortable when I call you ‘daddy’ during sex?” Is it ’cause you have daughters?” I said, “No. It makes me uncomfortable because I have a father. And I used to call him ‘daddy’ when he fucked me. So…” [Laughter] By the way, thanks for laughing at me ’cause I got fucked by my dad. [Laughter] I was not laughing at the time ’cause I was cumming, because he fucked me good. My daddy fucked me so good. It’s not his fault. I made him do it. I was such a brat. I was 10. I was like, “Daddy, fuck me!” The poor guy. He’s like, “I know I’m spoiling this child, but I can’t say no.” [Laughter] Thank you very much for coming. I hope that you enjoyed the show. Thank you for coming. Get home safe. Thank you. Good night. [Cheers and applause] [Cheers and applause continues] ♪♪ Dedicated to Lenny Bruce Your email address will not be published.

Let’s see who gets offended. [Music] [Applause] Thank you! Oh, my God, Austin, what the fuck is up? How is everybody? Good? Let’s go! Oh, my God, thank you guys so much for coming out. This is so cool. It means the absolute world. Thank you, guys. Ah, just checking you all out. This is fun. This is good. Gay? One for one, baby. Let’s go, let’s go! Oh, it’s the energy I was looking for. Thank goodness, man. Oh, my God, thank you so much for coming out twice. I appreciate that. It’s very brave, very great. I’ll be honest with you, I wish my entire crowd was gay, man, to be honest. It’s just an energy you want to be around, you know what I mean? I’ve never met a gay dude in a bad mood, not once. I’ve been so jealous of gay men lately. You have no idea. That’s what I’m talking about, man. I’ve been so jealous, man. It looks like a good time going on over there. I wish I was gay, for the fitness or the fashion alone. Are you kidding me? Oh, my God, I’m straight, but I’d love to be in gay shape, you know what I mean? You ever meet a gay dude? They’re in great shape, every fucking time, man. It’s so impressive. Gay dudes stay in the gym. That’s the guy’s name, Jim. They just stay in there. They’re just turning it out, burning calories, dog. It’s dedication. You better respect it. That’s next-level fitness, bro. That’s that level of in shape, like, you could fight off another grown man if you wanted to. You know, that’s up to you. You put in the work. Top or bottom, that’s you, dog. That’s your prerogative. God, if they’re not fucking shredded, they fucking dress impeccably. You guys look fantastic. Oh, my God. I don’t know if you guys know this, but gay men have a stranglehold on the fashion game. They are killing shit bro. Nobody in this world dresses better than gay men. You better respect it. It’s pretty impressive. I mean, you spend enough time in the closet, you’re bound to find something, you know. He goes… boots! Love it. Oh, man. Exhausted, man. We’ve been traveling a lot this year. It’s been very exciting. It’s one of the most fun parts about the job. Obviously, it’s a little taxing as well. I got a chance to go home recently. I’m originally from Ohio. I don’t know if anybody’s ever made that mistake. I never go home. I left 10 years ago, after high school, and that’s about it, man. I go home maybe once or twice a year. I’ll go home for Christmas or something like that, you know. I’ll go home for the holidays. I don’t mind that as much because whenever I go home for Christmas, I stay with my grandpa, and I love my grandpa to death. He’s probably the closest person to me in my family. And I love staying with him because whenever I’m not there, he lives by himself. My grandpa has lived alone for like 15 years. It’s been single 15 years. Hasn’t been on a date in 15 years. As you can imagine, carpal tunnel is on its way. And because he’s lived alone for so long, he’s kind of become this crotchety, grumpy old man. He doesn’t like anything or anybody. He complains all day long. You all know ',\n",
       "  'an old person like this. He’s always the hardest person to shop for, for Christmas, every year. So, two years ago, it’s mid-December, right? I’m at my place in L.A., I’m getting ready to go home, you know, finishing up all my online shopping. And it gets down to him. Every year, I’m sitting there, just racking my brain, I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude?” He doesn’t like anything. He doesn’t like anybody. He doesn’t have anybody. So, I bought him a pocket pussy. Normally, I would be like, “Does anybody not know what a pocket pussy is?” But this is Sixth Street; y’all be fucking banana peels, whatever y’all can find out here. Y’all in no position to judge my family, okay? Bro, I just wish y’all could have been there to see him open it on Christmas morning because we all thought he was gonna be like, “What the fuck is this shit?” He was like, “Thank you.” This is exactly what I needed.” I was like, “It’s a flashlight, not a Purple Heart, dog. Relax, okay? Stop feeling so honored.” He loved it, man. So obviously, Christmas is a good time. And then we fast forward a little bit. Now, we fast forward to that following February, and I hadn’t spoken to my grandpa since Christmas. So, I call him up. “Steve, Stephen, what’s up, man? How you doing? I love you. I miss you. My Christmas was fun. It’s always good to spend the holidays with you, you know. How was it?” And there was just a silence on his end of the phone. I was like, “Are you using it right now? Like, fucking answer me, dog. Like, what’s the review, you know? I’m interested.” He gets all defensive, and I’ll never forget these words for as long as I live. He goes, “No, no, no, no, no. I, uh, I broke her neck.” There is so much to unpack in that one sentence. First of all, “her”? You gave it a pronoun; now it’s real. Second, “neck”? That’s not even what it is. And third, you broke it, dog? How hard are you going? Fucking 15 years, you forget how to be a gentleman? So, we laughed on the phone for a couple of hours, and then now we fast forward to the following Christmas. This is last Christmas. Again, same time of year, going home, finishing up shopping, gets down to him. So now, I’m really struggling. I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude this year?” Like, how do I possibly top what I did last year, you know? Clearly, he enjoyed it, and now my man hasn’t had pussy since at least February. So, uh, I doubled down. Got him another one. I got him two pocket pussies, two Christmases in a row. I’m grandson of the decade, easily. Only, well, you know, obviously, I was a little bit more aware of what it was going to be put through this time around. I had to find it more and more durable, right? You know, something with a stronger neck. Now, I’m out here trying to find a pocket pussy with traps, trying to find my Papaw a trap queen for Christmas. And I– fuck… I couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for. I was so mad. And then, I think I found the next best thing. I found this other pocket pussy that I’ve never seen anything like it. It was remarkable. It came with– it was like so souped up, it came with all these, like attachments and pieces… It was like a Swiss Army pussy. It had a compass, a can opener, and it doubles as a canteen if you’re lost in the woods, I guess. But by far, the best attachment this thing came with was that, like, if you… if you… like, let’s say… you fucked this side of it, right? Like, this is the entrance. This side of it is a suction cup. The idea being, you can fucking put it on walls and shit, if you need to. I don’t know, switch positions, work your legs, you know, whatever it is, feel like you need it added to your repertoire, you know? And I got it for him, thinking like, “Yo, this is so creative.” You know, now my man’s got free roam in the house. You know, he’s not bed-bound, beating his dick like a pilgrim. He’s got options, you know what I mean? So, I was excited for him. But now, I’m fucking terrified to go home this Christmas, and there’s just gonna be chunks of drywall missing all around the house, waist level. “Doing a bit of remodeling, are we?” His house looks like a mid-demo project. Like, “Ah damn, Papaw, you literally fucked from the window to the wall.” [Applause] So, dick sucked down the hall. Oh, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve. He’s disgusting… but he’s funny, man. He’s very funny. I called him about a month ago, and I told him I was gonna start telling this story on stage because it’s 100% true. And I think the world should know that. And he’s got such a good sense of humor, man. He was joking with me back. He was like, “You keep telling people that story, I’m gonna leave it to you in my will.” Which I think would be fucking hilarious. I told him, “Yo, you should do that, because I’ll fucking, I’ll put your ashes in it, name it Ashley, and then I’ll fuck it. Just kind of keep it in the family, you know what I mean?” Just from generation to generation, just so he can meet his great-grandkids, you know. Just, guys, it’s called cremation, grow up, okay? Grow up. [Applause] It’s not your grandpa, and my grandpa’s funny, man. You guys would like him. You can judge them if you want to. At least he got somebody. It’s hard. It’s hard to find your person, isn’t it? Dating’s hard. It’s a very cliche topic. Every comedian talks about how hard dating is, but yeah, it’s a relatable ',\n",
       "  'subject. Something everybody goes through. You know, it definitely gets harder depending on where you live. Like I said, I live in L.A. now. It’s the fucking worst, bro. There are no good people. Bunch of fucking heathens running around. Nobody’s going to heaven. Not one person. City of Angels? No angels. It’s depressing, man. It’s so depressing, getting let down every time. Like, I just expect it at this point. Every first date I go on, as soon as I sit down, I’m like, “Alright, bitch, what is it? Ask me what my sign is. I dare you. I’ll split this check so fucking fast. I swear to God. Oh, you’re a Pisces? Awesome. Yeah, charge it to her crystals. They were in the moon all night last night. Clearly, that should stop.” I’m so fucking tired of hearing about astrology. I swear to God. It’s all y’all care about. I’ve stopped sending dick pics and just started sending my star chart, to be honest. It’s getting me so much further. So much further. [Applause] I hate it so much, man. I have so many red flags now, bro, and no patience. That’s the main thing. It’s like, I’ve been let down so many times. Like now, if I see something that triggers a red flag in me, I’m gone. I’m not gonna wait around to be inevitably let down, you know what I mean? It’s a waste of time. And I’ve got so many red flags. So, there are some that I want to get off my chest, and I think maybe we’ll find some common ground. Maybe you’ll think I’m crazy, but I think it’s worth finding out. And we’ll start slow. We’ll ease our way into it. We’re gonna start with red flag number one. And just a disclaimer, this one is not going to be the funniest one, but I do think it’s going to resonate with the most amount of people here. Red flag number one is when she had… that… That [ __ ] is red flag number one. Girls who don’t drink enough water, that’s what it is. Red flag number one is when she has another guy in her life who is consistently trying to sleep with her, and she refuses to acknowledge this. This is good. It’s gonna cause a lot of fights in the car ride home. It’s my favorite one. You clapping, you had a… you had an argument recently… Like I said, this isn’t the funniest one, but every dude in here in a relationship right now knows the guy in his girl’s life that he’s like, “fuck that dude. I’ll kill him tomorrow.” It’s so obvious to us, right? As the boyfriend, that shit is clear as day. We can spot it from a mile away. Usually, at the beginning of the relationship, we’ll clock it. We’ll pull you aside. “Hey, babe, I know you hang out with so-and-so, and that’s fine. You’re a grown woman. You can do whatever you want. I’m not controlling or anything. But just so you know, that dude’s trying to fuck you.” And women will always have the exact same naive reaction. “Babe, come on. Are you serious? Him? You’re worried about him? He’s literally like my best friend. Like, he’s literally like a brother to me.” “Word? Oh, that’s your brother? Oh, I didn’t realize what kind of PornHub family tree you were associated with, but shut it down, okay? He’s not your friend. He’s not your brother. He wants to enter your body holes. End of story. Okay?” Ladies, you have to understand. The reason we are so passionate about bringing this to your attention is not because we think you’re stupid. It’s not because we don’t trust you. It’s that you’re being taken advantage of. You’re hanging out with somebody who’s lying about their intentions so they can weasel their way into your life. That’s not a real friend. That’s some shady shit to do. So, we’re just trying to point out something that’s happening under your nose, so hopefully, you can be aware of it and put a stop to it. I promise you, we are coming at it with good intentions. And you still want to get mad at us and act like we’re the crazy ones making this shit up. “Oh, that is so ridiculous. Why would a guy go through all that trouble and pretend to be my friend just to sleep with me?” Okay, I don’t know, but I’ve done it so many times. How do you think I got you, stupid? Come on. Oh, my God, knuckle buddy! No, nobody has been a better friend than me. Are you kidding me? That’s why dudes can spot the shit ’cause fucking game recognizes game, you know what I mean? He’ll do some shady shit and we’re like, “fucking, good move. That’s what shit I would have done. You know, fuck you, but respect.” He is not your friend, ladies. And if you really do treat him like your best friend, oh, that’s so much worse because if you treat him like your best friend, that means you’ve gone to him with all of your secrets, all of your problems. He knows everything you like, everything you don’t like. You’ve probably complained to him about everything your boyfriend does wrong. So now, this motherfucker has all the Infinity Stones to become the perfect guy for him. So, when you and your boyfriend finally break up, who do you go running to? Me. And I’ve been waiting for this moment, boy, weeks, months, maybe years. I’ve been waiting for this exact opportunity, bro. I’ve been putting in work, too. I’ve been sending you memes in the morning. I’ve been texting you, “How’s your day going?” I don’t give a fuck about your day. Are you stupid? It’s about my day. I care about my day. Come on, man. It’s about patience. All I’ve had to do is play it cool and stay in the game long enough, and wait for th',\n",
       "  'e day that you come banging on my door, crying your eyes out. And I just have to play stupid, like, “Whoa, whoa, wait, why are you crying? He says he doesn’t trust me? It’s crazy. Y’all broke up? Oh my God, I am so sorry. Oh, some dudes are so insecure. Oh my God.” He’s not your fucking friend. Stop falling for his shit, ladies, I’m trying to tell you. Oh my God! Shut up. [Applause] Now, I understand this is the part of the red flag that I’m sure a lot of the women in the audience are thinking, “Well, Matt, what about the reverse? How about when a guy has a girlfriend? What about that?” And I hear you. Look, ladies, you can be – look, a guy can have a girl that is just a friend. No, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. I’ll wait. You, as a girl, can be just a friend to a guy, but it means you’re ugly. I’m sorry, I know you don’t want to hear it, but you are just a homie with a ponytail. I don’t know what else to tell you, man. Men and women can be just friends, but one of y’all fucking busted. Okay? Somebody’s ugly. Or maybe both of you are ugly. In which case you should be fucking anyways. That’s why it’s called bumping uglies. Like I said, it’s not the funniest one, but you got some thinking to do. Red flag number two: She cannot have any distinct physical features. I’ll explain. Nobody feel targeted. And before you get mad at me, I’m not even the shallow one in this red flag, by the way. It’s my fucking friends, because all of my friends are Black, and they will roast you within an inch of your life if you have anything prominent about your face that stands out at all. They have cost me so many potential relationships. I was seeing this girl last summer. I thought maybe she was the one, man. She was fucking beautiful. She was smart, funny, didn’t know her dad. She was new to town. She had just moved to L.A. from Austin a couple of months before I met her. Like, very, very sweet, innocent girl, right? We were hanging out for a while. We went on a handful of dates, and everything was going great. Until, just a couple of dates in, I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends of mine who I hadn’t seen in a while. So, you know, we’re hanging out, catching up, and they’re grilling me about, you know, what’s going on, what’s new, you seeing anybody? And I was so proud and excited to be seeing this new girl. So, you know, I broke out her Instagram. I was like, “That’s her.” And my friends immediately were like, “Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Which is Black for, “I’m about to hurt your feelings, bro.” They roasted this poor girl for, like, 90 minutes. Did I laugh? Yeah, but fuck those dudes. I’m not gonna stop hanging out with her over it, you know? I didn’t. We kept hanging out. We went on a few more dates until our last date, man. We were at dinner, and she just laid it out there. She was like, “You know what, Matt? I’m having a really nice time with you, and I think it’s time we take this relationship to the next level. And we need to start incorporating our friends into our hangouts, you know? I need to meet your friends. You need to meet my friends. We’ll all hang out together, see if our friend groups get along, you know?” And I was like, “Uh, why? You know, why are you trying to rush things? You know, I’m having such a good time getting to know you.” She’s like, “No, it’s important that our friends get along.” And I was like, “No, I hear you. I just don’t… I don’t think it’s such a good idea.” And she started to get really upset. She was like, “And why not?” And I was like, “Because we have the same chin.” She was like, “What?” I was like, “You have like a cleft chin. Like how I have. It’s very strong. It’s a very masculine facial feature. And like, I think it’s cute, obviously, but not everybody does.” She was like, “What are you trying to say?” I was like, “My friends are going to roast you. They’re gonna make fun of the way you look. I’m sorry. It’s just how they are.” “Oh, that is so childish. Like, what are they gonna say? That I have like a butt chin? Ooh, so original. Like, I’ve heard it all before, babe.” “And I was like, ‘Nooo, you haven’t.’ I don’t know how many Black friends you have, but this is kind of what they do. Okay? Do you know that they call you the Texas Chinsaw Massacre? Did you know that?” That was just off the top. She was so offended. “Oh, that is so rude. Is that all they know about me, is what I look like?” I was like, “No, they know you just moved here from Texas to be a chinfluencer, they said?” And now I miss her, man… I know. She was my little Chinderella… So stupid. I appreciate you wearing your best shorts. I know it’s hot outside. Like, this is still an event, you know what I mean? He’s like, “I know, I’m going to a comedy show, but just in case there’s a trampoline.” Didn’t even try. You mowing the grass after this? God damn, man. Whatever, it’s not your night. You’re right. Pressure’s on me. Red flag number three. Yeah, there’s more. Red flag number three: A big red flag for me is if I don’t have anything in common, like hobby-wise, with somebody. Like, it’s such a necessary relationship trait to have. I think it’s so easy to be physically attracted to somebody, obviously. It’s everyone’s first instinct. But I think if you want longevity in a relationship, you have to have that extra layer of compatibility, right? You have to want to do things t',\n",
       "  'ogether. I think, like, a big red flag for me is if a girl doesn’t go to the gym. And that’s just because it’s a very big part of my life. I love going. I go every day. I’m a very big advocate of going to the gym and working out. And it’s so good for your health, not just your physical but your mental health as well. Get your endorphins going, get some of that stress relief out of you, you know. But I do acknowledge that it’s not for everybody. It’s intimidating for some people who don’t go every day, and I try to be cognizant of that and try to help out the best I can. Like, there may be some people in here right now, or maybe watching at home, that want to get started and just don’t know how to take that first step. And if there is anybody out there, I highly recommend the program I just started about six months ago that changed my life forever. And that program is where I only work out with Black dudes exclusively. Because Black dudes will push you to your limits, whether you want to or not. I started about six months ago, man. I was in the gym one day, I was having a bad day, I was stressed about something, I was angry about something. And I was like, “Man, fuck this. I’m gonna use this negative as a positive. I’m gonna use this aggression, I’m gonna put up some weight.” And I’ll say it was chest day, so I was like, “fuck it, I’m gonna hit a new max on the bench press.” So I go in there, put the lighter weights on first, get loosened up, get warm, you know, then you gotta put on the heavier stuff. And when you do that, you’re supposed to have a, um, a spotter, so you don’t die. And I didn’t know anybody in there at the time. Closest person to me was this Black dude next to me. So I walked over, I was like, “Hey man, would you mind spotting me for this set real quick?” And he was like, “Yeah, I got you.” I was like, “I feel like you do. Everything about your voice is safe. I feel like I can lift the world now. Okay, come on.” So we go over to the bench together. He gets behind the rack in the spot position. He’s ready. I lay down, and I’m trying to psych myself up, get in the zone, line up my hands, get a good grip. And finally, I just get it off the rack. I get one rep in. Oh! I get two reps in. I hit a third, my arms start shaking, and he can see this. So like any good spotter, he has some words of encouragement. I’m trying not to die, and this man just gets in my ear. “Do that shit! Do that shit! You ain’t nothing!” I was like, “I don’t know, man. I’m getting kind of tired.” He was like, “My people been tired.” I was like, “God damn, I’m sooorry.” It was only like 255, you had white guilt on top, that’s like 500 pounds, man. I was like, “Is this pre-workout or a history lesson? What are we doing, dog?” I racked that shit up. I was like, “I appreciate you, man. I was struggling at the end.” He was like, “You don’t know struggle.” Fuck man, can’t have anything. So, that’s my new routine. Whenever somebody’s like, “You look good, Matt. You on a diet?” I’m like, “Yeah, it’s called White Watchers. You should try it. It’s when black people watch white people struggle. You will sweat, I promise you.” This is one of the whitest crowds I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Bro, I’m uncomfortable. You know, there’s so… Is this a comedy show or a meeting? God Damn! Oh my gosh. I’m sorry. Um, we could try something different. This could be fun, or it could be a fucking nightmare, but I think we can have fun. Um, so the thing is, it’s like, I could do red flags for hours, right? And they can be funny. We could all laugh, have a guaranteed good time, but who wants to do that? So, and a lot of times, I don’t like to do a lot of red flags because it is very male to female, you know? It’s listing things that men don’t like about women, and I don’t want that to be unfair, one-sided, or sexist. So, to even it out, sometimes I am genuinely curious. Like, for the women in the audience, what might be some red flags for a guy if you go on a date with them? He says or does this, that makes you kind of be like, “Oh, I don’t know.” I’m gonna go balcony. I’m gonna go balcony. What is it? Is it a good one? Splitting the check? Okay, splitting the check. Um, on a first date? He asked in the beginning of the date? Towards the middle? Oh, you were boring. In the middle? “Can I get you anything?” “Yeah, two checks. Two checks would be alright. Yeah, yeah.” So, where did you say you were from? How recently was this? Five months ago? Okay, and you’re still upset… Um, so hold on, where did you go to eat? What is it? The Gin and Temple? What is that? [Applause] Rude. What kind of restaurant is that? Yeah, yeah, catfish and steak. [Music] It’s like a Roadhouse, an expensive Roadhouse. Okay, well, yeah, I mean, maybe did you like him until that moment? Did you like him? [Applause] I’m curious. Until he asked to split the check, were you like, “This is going good?” You were… Fuck. Did you sleep with him? Wow. Oh my God. He split you and the check in one night! [Applause] Oh my God. [Applause] Did he leave a big tip? That was an unnecessary detail. Would did you say? He was sweaty after? Yeah, my man was putting in work. That’s just… That’s good… I think. Well, I’m sorry you got half of a meal. All right, well, one for one. What’s another fun one? \\xa0Do you have a fun one? What is it? This is going to get cancel',\n",
       "  'able. Let’s do it. So, you said it when he says he’s on hormone therapy, but he’s just fucking jacked. So, hormone therapy, what’s that supposed to do? Balance it out, basically? So, what he says, he has too much like natural testosterone. He doesn’t have enough. Okay. How long have you been seeing this man? 25 years. [Applause] What? Where’d you meet him? You met him when you were kids. So, he tells you he’s going on hormone therapy to get more testosterone, but you think he’s on steroids, you know? So, did you find them? Could you get me some? Thank you. I’m trying to get in gay shape, dog. Let’s go. I’m taking all the shortcuts. You did find some. Was it a needle or a pill? [Applause] She said she thinks he is in gay shape. The plot thickens. Oh my God, this is the bigger red flag now. He has his workout buddies. Do you have a picture of him? I want to see what his gaydar says about… Oh, God damn it. The phones are locked up. God damn, your phone isn’t a hormone blocker. God damn it. Okay, after the show, I want to see this. Yeah, that’s a valid red flag. You don’t want somebody who’s lying about an obvious appearance thing. Like, if you’re clearly on steroids, just open up, it’s fine. It’s fine to do it, if that’s the body you want and the life you want to live. You chicken fucking can do that. It’s fine, as long as you can still get your dick up, you’re fine. If you can’t, then it’s not okay. Stop what you’re doing immediately. Okay… Let’s unlock her phone. Can we unlock her phone? [Applause] Okay, okay, okay, okay. Bro, what if it’s just a picture of me? Oh my God, that’s it. That’s what you unlock them with, that fucking flying saucer. Can I see your phone? There we go, pass it over. Oh, this is great. This better be worth it. There we go, pass that back, there we go. I just gotta see a picture of this guy, and then I want to see what you think. I want to test this gaydar. Let’s go. Ah, damn bro. He had the traps that my grandpa’s pocket wishes it had. [Applause] Why is his neck so big? Oh my God, this looks so unsure. Okay, resident gay, what are we thinking? What are we thinking? What is it? The pose? He’s gay? Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Any excuse to drink, go ahead! [Applause] Let’s go. Whenever we out again an angel gets his wings. This is good, this is good, everybody knows that. Okay, two for two, good about to see. All right, that was good. We’re gonna do one more for an even three. I don’t know if you can top that, but what’s a more fun one? College baseball? Oh man, you’ve been fingered in a dorm for sure. Okay, good. Oh, okay, all righty, let’s dive into this. All right, all right. So, who went pro and didn’t take you with him? Who was it? [Applause] All right, what is it that you don’t like about college baseball players? The ego of playing a collegiate sport at a high level? You can’t be proud about that? The seventh pitcher on the team? I love how you’re clowning them for that, but Loki you fucked with the seventh pitcher on the scene… Your pussy is the ball pen, do you know that? Strike one. Is it just an ego thing? That’s the only thing you don’t like about it? Because he could just be proud to be playing a sport. I loved playing high school sports. I didn’t get to play at a college level, but I would have been very excited to. Oh, you never… You never fucked him? Damn, you couldn’t even fuck the seventh pitcher on the baseball team? Damn, strike two! Oh my gosh, where did you go to school? You didn’t go to school? You didn’t go to college? Strike three, bitch! [Applause] Oh my God, that could not have gone better. I could not have gone better. Oh my God. Have you tried Little League? For the Love of the Game. Come on, guys. Okay, well that was fun. It’s a fun portion. No more crowd work. Nobody else yell out anything. That chapter is done. That’s fun, that’s fun. I like doing that portion of the show because it’s like, obviously, I come out here, I list all these red flags and their standards that I’ve set for myself. But it’s nice to know where other people draw the line. You know, what are some other people’s red flags? Is it something that could apply to me? There’s a lot of self-reflecting that I think people need to do more often, especially when you’re single. If you’re single, use that time to do some self-reflection. Think about the kind of shit you like. I went through a horrible breakup at the beginning of this last year, and I thought it was such a low moment. I was like, this is such a lull in my life, nothing positive is going to come out of this. But I did some thinking, and it made me realize so much about myself, made me think about the standards I wanted to set. But it also made me think about how much I fucking hate being single. This shit is so trash. It’s so trash. People over-hype the fuck out of being single, don’t they? Especially the freedom aspect of it. As soon as you’re single again, all your friends are like, “Oh, you can go sleep with whoever you want.” No, you can’t. No, you couldn’t before. Why could you now all of a sudden? The factor of being single, to me, I don’t like. I don’t like sleeping with a bunch of different people anyways, because I don’t like… That’s not fun. [Applause] That’s not fun, man. I don’t… I don’t like inconsistent feedback. My ego can’t handle it, dog. I’m too fickle. Okay, I nee',\n",
       "  'd to know where I stand sexually at all times. Okay, that’s the best part of any long-term relationship. If you’ve been together long enough, you probably have pretty good sexual chemistry. That’s why you stuck around. You like what they like, they like what you like, messes pretty well. The relationship that I ended earlier this year, that was the best part about it. We stayed together months after we should have, just because we had that sexual chemistry. It’s a hard spark to walk away from. It’s fun, makes you feel good about yourself, you know. I was getting my ego stroked daily. Like, how the fuck do you walk away from that? It’s so much fun. I knew with this girl, there was like a certain position I could put her in, and if I hit her with like the right move, just bow, then like, she couldn’t handle that. Like, it was too much dick for her. She was like, “Oh, my stomach.” And I’m like, “Shut up. It is not in your stomach with your shallow guts. Whatever.” I should call her. Don’t call the ex, don’t do it. Don’t fall for it because sexual chemistry will make you ignore all the other red flags, the… you should be paying attention to. Like my ex and I, we had great sexual chemistry, but our communication was… terrible. We could never talk anything out. If there was ever a point that I needed to get across to her, I would just have to like finger her in Morse code. The next day, my boys are like, “How’d the talk go?” I’m like, “It was terrible. This… just sat back and rolled her eyes at me the whole time.” Luckily, I can read lips. [Applause] Hate it. But you know, single again, back to the streets. Now I just gotta have sex with all these women I don’t want to do. I don’t want to do it. I’d rather be in a relationship personally, but somebody had fucking other plans. And I want y’all to think about that the next time you’re about to chastise a dude for being a fuck boy. Like, “Oh, you just a… boy, you out here sleeping with all these girls, you don’t even want to be in a relationship, you’re just a fuck boy.” Maybe he’s not a fuck boy, maybe he’s sad. Maybe behind every fuck boy is a man who once loved too much. Okay, or maybe that’s exactly what a fuck boy would say. TBD. But while I’m single, I’m trying to use this time to be self-reflective, work on myself, think about what are some of the red flags I bring to the table. Is there something I could be working on? And a major one, a major red flag for me that’s been brought to my attention that I didn’t realize was as big of a deal as it is, and it’s, you know, in relation to the climate we live in today, and that red flag is that apparently, I’m not very PC. I’m not very politically correct. So, I don’t know if that term made it down here yet or not. Y’all, y’all don’t seem to give a fuck. So, and when I say that, I just mean like, I’m not one of those people who tries so fucking hard to like prove how woke, what a good person I am, because that shit comes across as so disingenuous and corny to me. Like, you’re clearly pandering so hard. You can be a good person without it being your entire fucking personality, you know what I mean? So exhausting, man. As long as, as long as you know your heart’s in the right place, you’re doing the best that you can, you don’t need to prove yourself on Twitter every fucking day. And obviously, I’m referencing the extremes, these like woke internet warriors or whatever you want to call these fucking losers, who spend their whole life trying to cancel people on the internet. That shit pisses me off so much because they’re ruining, they’re ruining a good agenda. Cancel culture is not necessarily a bad thing. I get what they’re trying to do, is eradicate negativity in the world and get rid of some bad, toxic shit, and we do need that. But a lot of that gets lost in translation when they carry it out because they themselves are such bitches dog. Oh my God, bro. And that drives me insane because I’m, I’m on their side. I hate the same shit they hate. Off the top of my mind, I can think of, um, homophobia. Homophobia is a massive pet peeve of mine because it doesn’t fucking affect you, who somebody else loves has nothing to do with you. And oh, and it is always the ugliest fucking dude who’s the most homophobic, isn’t it? The most toothless motherfucker from Corpus Christi. [Applause] “I’m, I’m not with that gay shit.” They’re not with you either, bro. Have you met a gay guy? They’re handsome. They’re in good shape. They can fuck your girl so fast. Okay, be thankful they took a competitor off the board. I hate it so much, man. There’s such a pain in the ass. And as, as you can imagine, you all have the internet, it makes our job incredibly difficult. Nope, nobody’s allowed to joke about anything anymore. Everyone wants to complain about every joke ever told. That’s so frustrating because, I mean, no, you guys have been here the whole show, you know I have a pretty fucked up sense of humor. Like, I love dark shit. Like, the darker the better, to me. I love that so much. Keep that same energy. Like, I love fucked up stuff, but again, I’m okay making those jokes because I know my heart’s in the right place. And even though I acknowledge that that sense of humor isn’t for everybody, I’m okay with that because I don’t need to impress everybody. The same way you wouldn’t try to be friends with ev',\n",
       "  'erybody, right? You’ll find your people as your life progresses. So, it’s like, yeah, I might get in trouble, or yeah, some people might not like the jokes that I tell, but I’m going to tell the jokes that I want to tell, and hopefully, my audience will gravitate towards that, and we can all get along and have a fucking cool friendship, you know. And it gets tricky sometimes. I’ll do jokes that a lot of people wouldn’t want to tell or don’t want to listen to. Sometimes, like, you know, sometimes I’ll do jokes about trans people because it’s funny sometimes. Not in a disrespectful way, it’s never disrespectful. I’m just making light of a situation so we can all laugh rather than be touchy and upset. That’s all it is. And this is what’s so funny: the energy in the room is exactly what I’m talking about. Subject matter is what triggers people. I haven’t even said the joke yet. All I’ve said was “trans people,” and everybody in here got a tigh asshole. Everybody, not you guys, but everybody else, everybody else tightened the fuck up. The special is presented by poppers. If you don’t know what poppers are, get you some gay friends. Change your life. [Applause] But that’s what I’m talking about. All I did was say a trigger word, and people are automatically already uncomfortable. You guys are worried about being canceled just being in the room. Like, it’s so funny to me because the jokes that I tell, they’re never disrespectful. They’re always with the utmost respect. It’s… I never want to hurt anybody’s feel… They’re just jokes, just to say some goofy shit make the world laugh, that’s all. And people will still come up after the show saying the same angry rant every time. Just fucking “You… you cannot make jokes about trans people. What they’re going through is so incomparable, and you can’t imagine how hard their life is, and the shit that they have to go through. Therefore, you cannot make jokes about trans people.” And I hear you, I hear you loud and clear. But… the point that you’re trying to make is, you’re saying I can’t make jokes about somebody because of how hard their life is. And you are making very valid points, that I don’t know how hard that life is. I imagine it is tremendously harder than my life. I can’t imagine how hard that is to go through, and I wish you the best of luck. But… at the same time, to retort that argument, you also don’t have the hardest life. You know who has life way harder than trans people, that we never talk about? People on wheelchairs. Think about it comparatively, people in wheelchairs have a much harder life. Do they complain about it? No. We gave them a couple of ramps and kept it pushing. We fucking… Look, somebody– some people are gonna think this is an insensitive comparison. I think it’s a step in the right direction personally. I think if we want to head towards trans equality, we fucking start with better parking, you know? It’s the least we could do. I don’t know where we’d put them, we can’t assign them anything. Just joking, just joking, okay, relax. Hey, look, if you let it be, this can be the most fun part of the show. Okay, if you just have fun for the next 15 minutes, we’re all gonna laugh at some things that we don’t think we’re allowed to laugh at. Oh, is it like a naughty thing if I laugh at a joke in a comedy show? Have fun. Okay, do not get sensitive now. Don’t fucking sit there and feel like you need to defend the wheelchair community. They can fucking stand up for themselves. Okay, God damn it, you guys. Stop being hesitant. Okay, look, people in wheelchairs come to comedy shows all the time. It is incredibly common. You know what? They are some of the best audience members you could ever ask for. They come, they laugh their asses off. And I’ll tell you the reason I believe that to be true. It’s because I think they’ve gotten themselves to this point of understanding and this positive mindset that no matter the hand you’ve been dealt in life, no matter how hard things might be for you, if you can learn to find the light in whatever dark situation you’re going through, and you can learn to laugh at the things that should make you miserable, including yourself sometimes, that’s how you fucking win life. And you are going to be a significantly happier person if you can learn to laugh in the face of adversity. I know this seems harsh, but I just have little to no respect for anybody who wakes up every day and makes the decision to live with a victim’s negative mentality of “oh, everything’s awful, everyone’s out to hurt my feelings.” Only because that’s not fair to you, that’s not fair to yourself. Your life is so short and so precious, you deserve to have the best fucking time you possibly can and laugh your way through life and be as happy as you can, no matter your circumstance or no matter what anybody fucking says about you. You deserve that. Have some fun. We’re only here for a second. Have some fun, man. And that’s why I chose the comparison that I did. A lot of people think it’s an insensitive comparison in the beginning, comparing those two groups. But it’s because of the positive message that I’m trying to put out there. And I want people to remember is that no matter what you’re going through, I would never negate that, but I want you to remember, if you think your life is hard, somebody has it worse. Try to',\n",
       "  ' remember that. Be grateful, be happy, and enjoy your time, no matter what. And that’s what I love about this example, is because if you think about the life of somebody in a wheelchair, that’s fucking hard. It’s a daily obstacle to overcome to do anything, every day. And the fact that they can laugh their way through that, we should all be able to. That’s what I have so much respect for the wheelchair community. [Applause] Because regardless of what they’re going through, people in wheelchairs are never annoying about their situation, until they’re getting on the bus. I don’t know how many of y’all have been stuck behind a city bus sending somebody in a wheelchair on, but it is fucking excruciating. You’re behind, I’m trying to make that right turn, and they’re fucking… “Put this motherfucker on the bike rack and let’s go!” That is the only time I have ever lost my patience on a handicapped person, is when they’re fucking up traffic. Okay, other than that, they’re angels. Look, if you’re still upset about the comparison, feel free to think about it and tell me I’m wrong. Let’s say you did, let’s say you took somebody with no legs and a trans person and you put them in the same room, the same handicap accessible room. See who you think has the harder life. “I just, I feel like I’m trapped inside of another person’s body.” “So, you have four legs?” “You’re… you’re not listening. It’s not about that. It’s a… Sometimes my mental health will take such a toll that I could just… I could just jump off of my balcony.” “Jump? What’s that?” “You’re… you’re not hearing… People will call me the wrong pronouns.” “Someone called me ‘Chariot Tubman’ the other day. You think a pronoun’s the worst thing you can be called? Come on.” Audience: What about a trans person in a wheelchair? Oh, you mean transportation? [Laughter] Don’t test me, dog. [Laughter] Oh, shit. Look, this is… this is a hard joke to pull off. It’s like a prosthetic leg; you just gotta… No, no, it is. It is, obviously, you take two marginalized groups of people who are going through a tough time, and you think you can’t make jokes about that, but you can. The joke works if my point is inarguable, and I think it is. I think those examples speak for themselves. I guess I just can’t wait for the day that I’m doing this joke at a show, and there’s a trans person in the audience who gets so offended they walk out, and I’m just like, “Show off.” [Applause] Some of y’all are still on edge, and it’s very annoying. Okay, I’m gonna give it one last try. I’m gonna give it one last try to get you all on my side. This is my last attempt to get through to y’all. Okay, I was working on this joke when it was like brand new, about eight weeks ago, right? I was in Arizona, and it’s a new joke. I’m trying to figure it out, obviously a little tricky to navigate, obviously a teeter on a very fine line of offensive and funny, which is where you want your jokes, you know. Have some fun, push the boundaries, you know. So, I’m working on it, I’m trying to make it the best it can be, and I can see out of the corner of my eye, front row, left side of the stage, is a young woman in a wheelchair. And I’m in the middle of like the trans versus wheelchair material, and I can see out of my peripheral vision, she’s laughing her ass off. She’s slapping her knee. She can’t feel it, but she’s slapping her knee, like, this bitch is rolling, you know what I mean? She’s fucking Ah, you know how they’d be laughing. Ah, handicapped people laugh like they’re getting good head, just… Ah. She’s so obviously having a great time, right? So when the joke was over, it dawned on me that I had a very unique opportunity to get an inside perspective on this material. And in order for a joke like this to work, it has to be funnier than it is offensive. And again, I want it to be, I never want to hurt anybody’s feelings. It’s just jokes, man. That’s as simple as that to me. But I’m always open to conversations. When the joke was over, I asked her, I was like, “Out of curiosity, was anything I said in that joke offensive?” And still laughing, this woman says, “No, no, no, no, no, it was… it was so fucking funny. And I want to thank you for including me.” I had never realized that so many people were so uncomfortable around handicapped people that a lot of the times, they won’t even laugh about some of the same things they want to laugh about, and things that they think are hilarious. So getting that confirmation is what gave me all the confidence I needed to know that these jokes are okay to tell, and we are allowed to laugh at them. You know, her and I, we were on the same page the whole time. We both know that’s what you do to vegetables; you roast them. [Applause] Bro, if you didn’t laugh at that shit, I would never be your friend. Fuck you, dude Fuck you, bro. Then I fucked her, that’s the crazy thing. It was after this show. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I’m not saying it was me, but she wasn’t walking the next day. I’m just saying, I’m just saying. I was like, “Can you feel it in your stomach?” She was like, “I can’t feel anything.” I was like, “Yeah.” My name is Matt Rife. Thank you guys so much for coming out. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause] Excellent. Um, thank you. [Applause] Listen, listen for one second. Um, first and foremost, thank you all so much. T',\n",
       "  'his means the absolute world to me. And I know, I know we laughed a lot in the past hour, but if you wouldn’t mind, there is something important I would actually like to share with you guys. And it’s something I wanted to address about the special. It’s very important to me. It’s the name of the special, “Matthew Stephen Rife.” Uh, it’s my full name. If you guys buy the DVD, you can get my Social Security number too, but it’s my full name, obviously Matthew and Rife being my first and last name, and my middle name being Steven. And I’m named after my grandpa. [Applause] The same… Pocket pussy Grandpa. And just to clarify, yes, that story is one thousand percent true, zero embellishment. He was… he’s a fucking monster. But the reason we’ve decided to name this special, it was gonna be named something totally different, and I wanted to dedicate this special to my grandpa because just under two weeks ago, he passed away. Um, and the whole show, I mean, this whole special taping almost didn’t happen. I mean, he was my absolute best friend, and I love him and miss him so much. He wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year. So, for this one, I was like scrambling. I was like, “Do I even want to do this? It doesn’t feel right to do a show without him.” So, I mean, we’ve scrambled together, we changed some of the set for it. It’s like, um, this right here is his hat that he wore every single day. There’s even a photo, it’s a black and white photo of like, he and I when I was a baby. I think, I mean clearly, we were on the set of one of his 70s pornos. And like I said, he, he wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year because it was kind of the height of COVID and everything. He also hadn’t been on a plane in like 30 years. So, for this one, a couple of months ago, like four or five months ago, when we decided we were going to do this special, I really, really wanted to fly him out here. He was very excited too, because I wanted to kind of immortalize and, in front of everybody that was here, tell him just how much he meant to me and just thank him for every single thing that he did. [Applause] You guys really don’t understand. Um, I spent every weekend with him when I was a kid. Like, he’s the one that showed me, like, all these funny things. We would sit around, watch Adam Sandler movies, and stuff like that, you know? Very inappropriate movies for a job. Um, and he was very funny. Like, he’s definitely the reason I have a sense of humor. When I was starting out doing stand-up, when I was 15, um, how open mics work, a lot of the times, I started out at the local comedy club in Columbus, Ohio, called the Funny Bone. And they would have these open mics. And how those work a lot of times is they’re called bringer shows. So you’d have to bring five people in order for you to get stage time. I was 15, all my friends were in middle school, so obviously I couldn’t have anybody come. So my Grandpa would buy five tickets so that I could get stage time and do this silly thing because he thought I was so funny. [Applause] I really wish he was here to see all of you people here. And just to let you guys know, if I have ever made any of you laugh ever, it’s because of him. [Applause] That’s why, when we were going over the stage decoration for how we were going to do this stage, I wanted it kind of plain and rugged. Um, but then, obviously, I wanted him here at the show so bad, which is why we decided to leave a seat open for him on the stage, want to watch the show. And as heartbreaking as it is that he couldn’t come and be at the show himself, um, fortunately enough, Ashley could. [Applause] So, in the name of Steve, this one’s for you, Papaw. [Applause] Hey, everybody, thank you so, so much for tuning in to this special. This is our second self-produced special, and it means the absolute world to me that you guys tuned in in support of this. And for anybody who might want to show any additional support, we just added a bunch of new merch on my website at mattrifeofficial.com. We just added t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, hats, bracelets that you can actually pay anything you want for. And all the money we are making for Merch is going towards the next Third self-produced special we’re putting out next year. And to top it off, we are going to auction off the star of the second special, not me, um, Ashley herself. And I have signed it for you. It’s from me. It’s from the show. It’s a little creepy, a little sexy, a little gross. My grandpa for sure possesses it. But so can you. So thank you so much again for tuning in. I hope you enjoyed it and see you at the next one.

[door opens] [audience cheering loudly] [door closes] [Pete] I just, uh… I just turned 30 this week, so yeah. [audience cheering] No, it’s over, dude. It’s over. I just, uh… I had to stop doing hard drugs ’cause you can’t… can’t be a drug addict in your thirties. I’m not that guy. You know that guy that can just do one bump of coke? He’s like, “Oh, I’m so bad!” [audience laughs] Or that guy who’ll have two beers, like, “I might have diarrhea tomorrow.” You’re like, “Fuck you, dude, you fuckin’…” Doing drugs in your twenties is fine. There’s an excuse. You’re like, “I’m finding myself.” You know? It’s cute, you know? Do a little bump off an iPad with your friends? It’s adorable. Say cute things like, “I’m a crispy little dolphin.” You know? All your boys are like… [makes dolphin sounds] You know? Then one of your boys has a kid, and you’re holding it, you’re like, “I think I’m a drug addict. I think I need some help.” I was on a magical drug for the last two-and-a-half, three years, called ketamine. It was amazing. What a time! [audience howls] I thought of amazing ideas, great ideas. Like, uh, an Italian sleep aid called [in heavy Italian accent] Melatone. Sorry. [audience laughs] [chuckles] Sorry. So dumb. You go to sleep right away with [in heavy Italian accent] Melatone. Sorry. No prescription. Some guy just gives it to you under a bridge and kisses you on the cheek. [audience laughs] [in heavy Italian accent] “Take one when you hit the turnpike. Alright, hey.” Sorry. If you don’t know ketamine, you probably did it accidentally if you’re a coke head. Yeah. You’ll be doing coke all night. You’ll do one bump, and be like, “Whoa.” “This is not cocaine.” “Also, am I gay?” [audience laughs] It’s embarrassing when you’re not on ketamine anymore. You’re like, “Ooh.” “Ugh!” “I’m embarrassed. I was out and about like that. That’s not cool.” You know? I was at funerals like that. That’s fucked up, right? I was at Aretha Franklin’s funeral like that. Yeah, I have to live with that. She’ll never know, but still, it’s not the point. If she was there, she’d probably be like, “Hey! Who are you and what the fuck are you doing at my funeral?” It’s embarrassing. I was so high I thought it was a good idea to say to her family, “Hey, I’m just here to pay my R-E-S-P-E-C-Ts.” [audience laughs] Yes. I started renting movies on Apple. Fuck Apple and their rental service! Scumbags! They’re like the mafia, those fucking assholes. They’re such assholes as a company. Did I buy the new phone? Of course, but… fuck them! They’re like the mob. Like, “You’re not getting our new phone? Okay.” “Guess whose phone’s at 43% forever. Fuck you.” “Every day of your life is now a guess, my friend.” “You just buy your new dream car? Save up?” Oh, great. Charger port’s different. Yeah. Every time you get a blow job now, you gotta be like, “Sorry, they got a new charger. Sorry about that.” “Yeah, I know. Apple! I know.” Sorry. Scumbags! You ever go to rent a movie on Apple, and it’s $4.99 to buy and $3.99 to rent? And you’re like, “Fuck you, dude!” Really? You’re going to make me own Jeepers Creepers 2? You fucking assholes! I don’t know. My mom’s having a midlife crisis. Uh, yeah, she’s really far up my ass right now. You know, she’s 55. She hasn’t been with anybody since my',\n",
       "  ' dad died. So it’s been like 23 years since she’s, you know, spread ’em, I guess. I don’t know. She called me, having a midlife crisis. She was like, “I want to get a facelift.” I was like, “For what? You don’t even use your face.” [audience laughs] I’d get it if she was out getting tagged or something. You know, what you getting a facelift for? To watch Grey’s Anatomy? [audience laughs] [in high-pitched voice] “I love Eric Dane.” Yeah, my mom won’t fucking date. I’m trying to get her to date. She was like, “Your father was my man.” You know? [woman] Aw. No! It… “Aw” at first. It’s been 20 years of this fuckin’ Nicholas Sparks bullshit. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of it! She needs to get out there. Okay? She needs to sign up to Hinge or fucking Bumble. Whatever the fucking… The one the ladies get to choose. Whatever. Girls are so cute. They’re like, “It’s cool! We get to choose who comes on our face.” Anyway, um… [audience laughs] “Ain’t that nice?” She needs to get out there ’cause all that weird energy that’s supposed to be on a cock goes to me and my sister, okay? And it’s fucking weird. I’ll go over to my mom’s. I’ll hang out, eat dinner for an hour, and she’s like, “Where you going?” I’m like, “Home. What do you mean?” Unless we’re about to fuck in the shower, I don’t… My duties as a son are done. [audience laughs] It’s to the point where I might fuck her just to get her off my back. [audience laughs] Yeah, that’s right. “Maybe you’re just not as good of a son as you think you are, huh?” I’m the fucking son of the century right here! Give me my ribbon! If I fuck my mom over Thanksgiving, my grandpa would kiss my forehead, and go, “I heard what you did for your mother. You’re a good son.” “She’s smiling finally, hey.” She needs to get out there. I’m trying to find her a suitor. Someone to fuck my mom, that’s a difficult thing. You want it to be good but you want the guy to be good. And that’s… You know, that’s a rarity. You want the type of guy that fucks her missionary-only. But still makes her come twice, rolls over. Hands her the remote, goes, “Heard Dancing with the Stars is on.” You know, that guy. Where is that guy? My mom’s a good catch. 55, hasn’t been with anyone in 23 years. It’s like fucking brand-new down there. Refurbished iPhone, right? You know? Screen cracks. “Should I get a new one?” “No, send it to this weird company called Insureon.” In three weeks, you get it back, and when you charge it, it’s all weird, but it gets the job done pretty much. That’s my mom’s pussy, dude! Fifty-five, hasn’t been with anyone in 23 years. Brand-new down there. She’s like a classic car. She’s like a ’68 Mustang with like 2,000 original miles on it. All original interior. You go to the dealer, get behind the wheel, like, “Where the fuck’s this been hiding?” “It’s brand-new in here! What’s its story?” Then the guy’s like, “Well, some old guy had it and died.” “And his son kept it in the garage for 23 years.” “But better make a move fast.” “I hear the son’s thinking of keeping it for himself.” [audience laughs] “Hey, I like the way she drives.” “This thing is priceless to me.” My mom was a single mom, you know. But all moms are single moms, you know, right? You know you’re alone, right? My mom was so tired all the time. And now that I look back, horny apparently. “Horny and tired.” So, like, I-I-I never wanted to tell her any of my troubles, because she had no time for anything. And any time I told her a problem, she always had one solution. She’d be like, “You should take a nap.” No matter the severity of the situation. That’s the type of person my mom is. In complete denial. Both my wrists could be cut, and I could be holding a knife. Like, [in screeching voice] “I don’t wanna be here!” She’d be like, “Have you slept today? You look tired.” She’s that type of mom, you know. And I remember I had a huge problem when I was ten. I thought I was gay, you know. I was wrong, but I thought, at ten, because I was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio, I was in love. Yes. I was into girls too, but I’m from Staten Island. In 2002, no girl was hotter than Leonardo DiCaprio in Staten Island. What a piece of ass he was, oh my God. He still gets pussy today based off what he looked like in 2002. He is the GOAT. I hope he never gets married. Running the best catch and release program the universe has ever seen. Leave him alone. I hope one day I get invited to the big yacht in the sky. With Tobey Maguire and sometimes Emile Hirsch, you know. “Matching Dodger hats, chicks half our age, guts going.” He don’t give a fuck. Leonardo DiCaprio don’t give a fuck. He’s all schleppy.',\n",
       "  ' He’s not even in shape. He’s all fucking fat, slowly morphing into Jack Nicholson. He don’t give a shit. Walking around on his yacht, looking at babes. Going, “Hey, uhh, I still fuck.” “Uhh!” “Uhh! I still fuck. Uhh!” “I make one movie so good every three years, I just get to fuck. Uhh!” “The ice caps are melting. Uhh!” So when I was ten, I was on my porch all gay, thinking about this guy. Fresh off of a double-VHS of Titanic. “Spit in my mouth, Jack,” I would say. [audience laughs] “Let’s fog up a Model T together.” My dream is to be Fabrizio. [audience laughs] You know, that’s my dream in real life. ‘Cause Fabrizio was Leonardo’s best friend and then he died. That’s my dream, dude. [audience laughs] [chuckles] So I remember I was sitting on my porch, you know, and I was like, “How am I going to tell my mom I’m gay?” You know what I mean? My mom’s an Irish Catholic Staten Island mom. She didn’t tell me I was Jewish till I was 25, and that’s because I found out. I did a 23andMe or ancestry, whatever. One of my boys did it. He came back Neanderthal. And he was talking all this weird Neanderthal shit. He was like, “I’m Neanderthal, actually the rarest fucking…” [mumbles] I was like, “You’re sill a dork. You’re still a fucking stupid dork.” But he was talking all this shit, I was like, “I got to get swabbed. Maybe I’m Neanderthal or something.” And it came back, I was like 50% Jewish. And I called my mom, ’cause I was raised Catholic and… [mimics chanting] All that forever. You know. I was like, “Mom, am I Jewish?” She was like, “Yeah.” [audience laughs] So how am I going to tell her I’m gay? So I was sitting on my porch all gay. My mom pulls up, right? Slams the car door. She looks at me, goes, “What’s wrong?” I go “Nothing.” She says, “No, what’s wrong?” I guess she noticed I looked a little gay. I go, “I think I’m gay.” She goes, “Are you tired?” And I go, “No, I’m just… I don’t think sleeping fixes homosexuality.” Imagine if it did? Imagine if gays are just tired. Elton John must be exhausted. [audience laughs] She goes, “Why do you think you’re gay?” I go, “‘Cause of Leonardo DiCaprio.” She goes, “That’s not gay.” I go, “It is. I have posters of him in my room.” Like Titanic and the beach. Not even the movie The Beach, just him on the beach. With Tobey, you know? Matching Dodger hats, you know? She goes, “That’s not gay.” “Yes, it is.” Right there, that was too long of a problem for my mom. She just snaps. She just goes, “All right! You wanna know if you’re gay, Peter?” I’m like, “Whoa, what the fuck is this, a circus all of a sudden?” “Step right up! My son the queer!” I was like… [audience laughs] I’m like “Relax, we have neighbors. They’re starting to gather.” She goes, “This is how you know you’re gay. Let me ask you this.” “Do you want to suck his dick?” I don’t know what that means. I’m ten. I just don’t answer. She goes, “Do you want to suck his dick?” And I just keep going… ’cause I don’t know what that is. She goes, “Pull his pants down, grab his dick, you know, put it in your mouth till it expands.” I was like, “What? Expands? What the fuck are you talking about?” I’m ten! I got a baby button cock at the time. ♪ Baby button cock Little weird boy cock ♪ [audience laughs] It expands? What the fuck you talking about? She goes, “Do you wanna get fucked from behind, Peter?” “By Leonardo DiCaprio?” “Do you want to look behind you and Leonardo DiCaprio’s behind you, puts his dick in your butthole, it expands?” I was like, “You gotta stop with the expansion thing.” I’m ten, it’s 2002. Only expansion I’m aware of, Houston Texans are now in the NFL. That is it! I don’t know about cock expansion, Mom. She goes, “You get fucked from behind by Leonardo.” “And he’s going to town, and he mushes your face in the pillow.” “You’re down there for 20 seconds, and then you look up, and all of a sudden, Leonardo’s outside the window waving at you.” “You’re confused, ’cause you’re still getting fucked from behind.” “And then you look behind you, and it’s Tobey Maguire! Tobey Maguire!” “Is that what you want?” I was like, “Sounds like you need a nap, and that’s what you want, psychopath.” I just said, “No!” And she goes, “Not gay.” [audience laughs] This is going to sound weird. I don’t like doing Make-A-Wishes. Um… [audience laughs] Just ’cause they’re sad, that’s all. By the way, not getting a lot of offers, might add. Believe it or not, it’s not a lot of people’s dying wish to meet me. It’s usually their wish for me to die, actually. Complete opposite. There’s a foundation for that. I don’t like doing them ’cause they’re sad, that’s all. They make me really s',\n",
       "  'ad, especially when you’re in a k-hole. When you’re on ketamine, and they say, “This kid is sick.” You’re like, “I know.” “And I’m pretty sure I could cure him.” [audience laughs] “Listen to Alan Watts and put on The Last Dragon. Let’s go.” Sorry. They’re just sad, that’s all. The Make-A-Wish Foundation called, “We got one for you!” I was like, “That’s a weird way to go about it.” Right? I don’t know the right one, but… Not like, “Hey, we caught one! Real sicko! A real sick one.” “That’s what we do.” They call me, “His name’s Kevin, he’s dying of cancer.” I said, “That’s so sad. I’m sorry.” They’re like, “His dying wish is to meet you.” I said, “Is it brain cancer?” [audience laughs] So I set it up. They ask, “Do you want to do this?” I was like, “Yeah, I just drove into a house, I could use good press.” [audience laughs] In my defense, that house cut me off, all right? That fucking… Just fucking… They didn’t put that in the article. So I’m nervous, because I’m not a good Make-a-Wish guy candidate. If there was a Make-a-Wish video game, I wouldn’t be a character you could select. Like, “Pete Davidson!” You know? It wouldn’t be me. You know who’s good at that? Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp comes in dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow. He’s like, “Hello, children.” [mumbles] And the kids are laughing, and the nurses are wet. It’s fucking awesome. They’re fucking all, like, soaked. He’s good, you know? Or John Cena, the wrestler. He’s amazing. I think he’s done the most ever. God bless him. He comes in. He has, like, a championship belt. He’s all wrestlery. He’s like, “What’s up, son? How you doing, champ?” The kid’s like, “Oh!” And then he’s like, “Wanna hold my belt?” “Huh? Wanna hold my belt?” I’m watching, like, “I don’t have a belt. What am I going to do? I got nothing.” Give him my phone and say, “Scroll to the right”? “Want to see some ass, dude? Fuck yeah.” “Yeah, she’s cool, dude.” “She’s actually your doctor.” Anyway… [audience laughs] So I was all nervous, you know, ’cause I want to show up for this kid. I want to kill it, you know. The Make-A-Wish, not actually… That would be easier. Wouldn’t that be great? You get murdered by your favorite celeb. “It’s been great. Yep.” Bang! [audience laughs] So I was thinking, “What’s my belt?” I want to crush this. This is a huge deal. I want to do well. And I was like, “Ooh.” I was like, “Okay, let’s think about it.” The kid is going to die, right? That’s… No, I’m not being a dick. That’s just what a Make-A-Wish is. That’s all. Otherwise, why would you hang out with a kid for three hours? That’s weird, you know. You’d be a pedophile, actually. Ironically, for a pedophile, that would be their Make-a-Wish, you know? Hang out with a dying, weak one, you know? [audience laughs] Yeah, I don’t give a fuck. I was molested, so I can make those jokes. I don’t give a shit, so there you go. [audience cheers] I’m not saying that to be cool. I just don’t have the Internet. I don’t do interviews. I don’t wanna be like, “Well, actually…” [audience laughs] I was like, “This kid’s gonna die, there’s nothing I can do.” Right? But what I could do, I could tell him all of my secrets. Right? I have a lot of secrets. I don’t kiss and tell ’cause I’m an old-school broad. I keep it to the chest, and I hope God gets you. That’s how I roll. I have a lot of secrets, things I can’t tell my friends or my therapist, ’cause I don’t trust them, you know. And I’m pretty sure one of them works for the Daily Mail. [audience laughs] But I was like, “I can tell this kid ’cause it’s not going anywhere.” It’s like a sure thing. Very few things in life are sure. It’s kinda nice, you know. So that’s what I did. I hung out with him for three hours, sung like a canary. Told him everything. “This guy’s actually cool, this guy’s not.” “This guy’s in the Illuminati, this guy needs to be burned to come.” One of those is me, and I won’t tell you which one. We had an amazing time. He was so happy. I was so happy. A huge weight was lifted off of me too. I got to tell him some stuff, get some stuff off my chest. It was great, beautiful. He hugged me. He said, “That was so much fun. I’ll see you around.” I was like, “Well, I don’t know about that, but… you know…” I was like, “Godspeed, little man, you know.” How cool was that? Hit him with a “Godspeed.” Huh? How often do you get to do that in life? I remember driving home, like, “Godspeed, you motherfucker. That’s pretty cool.” “What are you, Magnum PI? That was awesome.” And I felt great. And then a week went by, and I went on the Make-A-Wish website, and the kid was still alive. [audience laughs] [audience laugh',\n",
       "  's] Started getting a little nervous. I don’t know who this kid knows. So I called up the foundation, check up on him, you know. Make sure no miracles are afoot. [audience laughs] Hey, I held up my end! I was promised a dead child! [audience laughs] I’m tired of people lying to me! So I call up the fucking Make-A-Liars. I go, “Hey, you fucking lying sacks of shit.” They go, “Who is this?” I go, “It’s Pete Davidson.” They go, “Kevin was just telling us what a wonderful time he had.” I go, “I had a great time too.” “He said you really shared a lot.” I go, “Oh fuck, did he?” I guess a pinky promise means dick to Kevin. I go, “How’s he doing?” They go, “Well, not well, but there’s always hope.” I go. “Yeah, well, how much? How much hope do you think? ‘Cause if cancer don’t get him, I will, at this point. He knows too much. They go “We appreciate your concern.” I go, “Oh, I’m very, very concerned.” “You let me know when it happens.” They go, “We will.” Hung up. Next week, I was freaking out a little bit. Just looking at the phone. And then, you know, finally. Yeah. [audience laughs] They called, you know, and, uh, yeah. Wish fulfilled. [audience laughs] Joke over, he dies. That’s it. There is no happy ending. It is a happy ending, in that it’s exactly what was supposed to happen. I was watching Chappelle specials, and I noticed… Yeah, he’s the best. I noticed when he’s crushing and having a good time, he’ll be like, “Aah!” That actually hurt a little bit. Chappelle got some thick legs doing that. I was like, “I wish I had one of those things, where I’m crushing, and I get to…” Whatever that… Maybe when I’m doing well, I-I-I-I’ll go like this. “Wish fulfilled.” [audience laughs] Maybe… Maybe I’ll carry around packing peanuts in my pocket, and after a punchline, I’ll be like… [audience laughs] It’s been a very sad year. I lost my stalker. I think that’s sad, you know? You really don’t know what you got till it’s gone. [audience laughs] You know, I remember when I first met my stalker. She was outside my house. It’s weird when you get a stalker, ’cause there’s two parts of your brain. First time you get a stalker, you’re like, “Oh my God, this is so weird and scary.” But there’s the other part of your brain, “I guess I’m doing well.” [giggles] Then you get a good look at your stalker, and you’re like, “Maybe not so well, huh?” I’ll never forget. I met her. She was outside my house, wearing a shirt with my face on it. And it wasn’t even a flattering photo. It was like blown up and warped. My eyes were all over. It was like a nightmare. It was so… It insulted me. It was so bad. I wanted to go up to her and be like, “Hey.” “If you’re ever going to do this, like, here’s five photos of myself that I like, okay?” So, you know, I pull up, she’s out there. She’s a stalker, so, you know. Not hot, you know? That’s what you picture when you picture a stalker. Not hot. If they were hot, they wouldn’t be a stalker, they’d be my girlfriend. So… yeah. “How much do you love me? We’ll figure it out. Get up there.” So I’m outside, right? And I pull up, and she’s there. And I don’t have a gun, right? But she doesn’t know that, right? So I was watching a lot of SVU at the time, and when they’re approaching the perp, they get out of the car, they show their gun, and they usually put it in their jacket like this, and they walk to let ’em know they got one, but not to alarm people. And I didn’t have a gun, but she don’t fucking know that, right? So I made a finger gun, and I put it in my pocket like this. And I started walking towards her, okay? So I’m looking at her like this. And she’s kind of smiling at me. She’s kinda… I was like, “Why is she smiling?” Then I was like, “Oh. She thinks I have a boner.” Okay, yeah. This is like her Make-A-Wish. This is… And I literally went, “Not a boner, just a finger gun,” which I think is worse. I should have just had a boner, to be honest with you. ‘Cause now I’m a loser in front of my own stalker, and I’m… Now she’s winning. Now I’m bothering her in a weird way. So, I go, “What are you doing here?” And I don’t know where to look ’cause I’m on her shirt, and I’m all over the place. And she’s… I’m a little scared to talk to her, so I’m just, like, confused. I said, “What are you doing here?” And she just said, “I love you!” You know. I was like, “That’s very nice, but you can’t be here.” And she goes, “Why?” I was like, “I don’t know, it’s never gotten this far, to be honest.” Usually you go, “Get the fuck out.” People say, “Sorry!” I didn’t expect someone to challenge. I was like, “I don’t know, you just can’t be here.” And she was like, “Why?',\n",
       "  '” I was like… I don’t… I don’t know where to go. I was trying to think what to say, and then I was thinking about it. She seemed a little nuts, you know? You know, I… I’m crazy. So crazy people could, you know… Like, we can tell. She’s definitely a little nuts. She’s, you know… First of all, look at the shirt, you know. You know. And she’s stalking me, you know what I mean? That’s… So I felt a little bad. I was like, “You got to be nice and careful with the situation,” right? So I told her. I was like… I kind of went elementary school on her. I went like, “Hey.” I was like, “You can’t be here because this is where I go poopy.” [audience laughs] And after I said that, a little light flickered in her eye, like she was a Who from Whoville. She was… She was like, “What?” I said, “Yeah, I go poopy here.” She goes, “Ugh.” “You wouldn’t want to be here while I’m doing that.” And she goes, “No!” I got a little embarrassed. I was like, “Why? You’d be so lucky.” “You’d be so lucky if you were around my poopy.” She said “What?” I was like, “Never mind. Yeah, you shouldn’t come here.” “I could be pooping and that’s gross.” “And I have Crohn’s, so it could be a war zone up there.” And she was like, “Okay, I’m sorry. I won’t ever come back here.” Then she left. Right? I thought the problem was solved. No, that is just our first encounter. Okay? It’s a very long story, so buckle in. Also, I do have Crohn’s. I told people I had Crohn’s when I was like 19, 20, ’cause I had it really bad, and then now it’s mostly fine, like, 90% of the time. Uh, but like, I… It’s weird. I don’t like telling people that, like, ’cause I got good meds ’cause things are going all right, so I’m doing okay… But the reason why I thought… that’s a gross thing to say, but I have to say it because people come up to me outside, and try to bond with me over Crohn’s. And it’s just like… Not even at the bathroom, you know what I mean? I’ll just be in line at a store, and someone’ll come up to me and be like, “Hey!” “Me too.” [audience laughs] And I’m like “What?” And they just go, “Yeah.” “I got a poopy butthole as well.” “Name’s Phil.” I’m like, “Ugh! Fuck it.” I don’t have the heart to say, “I don’t have your Crohn’s.” I’m like the Magic Johnson of Crohn’s. Okay, so… I go out of town, right? My mom and my mom’s 79-year-old friend Terry are watching my house. Terry is a girl. My mom told me I have to tell people that Terry is a girl after a show once. She was like, “Terry could also be a guy’s name, and we love Terry, and if this comes out, and people start…” “We don’t want anyone to think she’s a guy so you should say that she’s a girl.” And I said, “Hey, Mom.” “Nobody gives a fuck about you or Terry.” [audience laughs] So my mom and my mom’s 79-year-old female friend Terry are watching… Yeah, now the joke’s gonna work! They’re watching my house, okay? My mom is oblivious to reality. She’s a very smart lady, but she’s just… She’s one of those moms that’s always like, “Really? No!” Just doesn’t believe anything. I told her. I said, “Someone knows where we live.” “Someone could come over and hurt you.” And she goes, “No. No, they’re looking for you.” “They’re not gonna… They’re not gonna hurt me.” I’m like, “That’s fair, but could you humor me? This is scary.” And I was like, “There’s someone… I have a stalker.” “And you just gotta be aware in case she comes by.” She goes, “All right. What does she look like?” I was like, “You’ll know. Trust me. Unmistakable. Okay?” So I go out of town. Okay, stalker comes back, she rings the doorbell. My mom answers and goes, [high-pitched voice] “Hey, who are you?” That’s what my mom sounds like, by the way. Like an Adam Sandler Hubie Halloween character. [in high-pitched voice] “How you doing?” So fellas, imagine that while you’re tagging it. [in high-pitched voice] “Ooh!” She’ll probably say things like, “Ooh, thank you! Thank you!” She’s been out the game so long, she don’t know dirty… “Thanks, sir!” So my mom goes, “Hey, who are you?” Stalker goes, “I’m Pete’s friend.” My mom, of course, goes, “Well, come on in.” [audience laughs] Stalker proceeds to watch Grey’s Anatomy with my mom and Terry for three hours. Three hours goes by, my mom finally thinks, “Maybe I should call Peter.” “See if he’s coming by to hang out with his friend.” She calls me, goes, “Hey, where are you?” I go, “London.” She goes, “Oh, well, your friend’s here.” I go, “Is she hot?” And my mom goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Eh…” And I go, “You’re under attack!” [audience laughs] “Run for your fucking life!” I go, “Very important. Go to the garage and call the cops.” “But pretend like nothing’',\n",
       "  's wrong, okay?” Now, I hope none of this ever happens to any of you, but I did get to hear my mom act on the phone. Which is priceless for me. My mom is always like, “Put me in your stuff.” I was like, “All right, make it to the garage.” You make it… You make it to the garage, you get an audition or something, yeah. My mom goes to the garage, I go, “Call my boy.” Don’t know if anybody has a boy like this. A friend you’ve been friends with for a decade. You do drugs almost every day together, then you don’t see him for three months, then the next time you see him, he’s just a cop. [audience laughs] And you’re like, “Tasty?” He’s like, “Uh-huh! Officer Tasty now.” You know? Better change your name in my phone to Officer Tasty. So Tasty goes over. I’m on speakerphone now with Tasty, my mom, and my stalker. Female Terry fled, okay? [audience laughs] Tasty goes, “We got her. What do you want me to do?” I was like, “You’re the cop.” He goes, “I have her in handcuffs.” I go, “Very good. That’s good.” He goes, uh, “She’s holding a present.” I go, “Okay.” I was like, “Open it.” He goes “What?” I go, “Open it.” He goes, “Why?” I go, “It’s a present.” What do you mean? She’s a stalker. She probably knows me pretty good, you know. Probably a good gift. I dunno. I get a lot of shitty gifts. She might… He goes, “Bro, it could be a bomb!” I go, “Dude, she can’t make a bomb.” “She can’t even make a t-shirt. You think she’s gonna fucking… put a bomb together, dude?” He goes, “All right.” I’m on speakerphone. I just hear this… [mimics scraping sound] And then my boy just goes, “Oh!” “No!” “Bro!” “This is disturbing!” Which is a very big word for Tasty. He’s never pulled the three syllables before. [audience laughs] I go, “What is it?” He goes, “Bro, it’s 20 pairs of soiled underwear.” [audience laughs] Fuck you! No one’s ever done that for you. Don’t talk about my girl like that. Only I can. You wish your girl gave you 20 pairs of dookie drawers. Yeah. It’s fucking thoughtful. I called my girl, like, “You gotta step it up!” “You never even met female Terry.” [audience laughs] Twenty pairs? Yes, it’s gross, but it’s thoughtful. One pair is gross. One pair is a hit. That’s a fuck you. “Here’s my shit.” You know what I mean? Twenty pairs is a crime of passion. [audience laughs] Yeah, it’s crazy, but then again so is love. I have Crohn’s. Maybe she was trying to communicate through some weird fecal matter thing. I don’t know, she’s bonkers. Twenty pairs? That’s thoughtful. That takes time. You can’t knock out 20 pairs of doody drawers in one day. Even if you had diarrhea, by the 11th pair, it’d be a little light. [audience laughs] I like to think it was a day at a time. I do, every night. I like to think about it. I like to picture, you know? She comes home from a long day of eating Hot Pockets on an Acer computer, right? She runs upstairs, you know. She starts undressing, you know, in front of the wall of Pete. It’s all posters of me, but she don’t know how to make posters, so I’m all just… [audience laughs] …everywhere. She puts on a sexy song. Well, sexy to her. So like “Mambo No. 5” or some shit. [chuckles] She starts the séance, lights a candle, blows it out with a fart, you know, gets it going. She looks up at me. I’m looking at her somewhere. And she plants ’em. ♪ One, two, three-four-five ♪ [audience laughs] [hums Lou Bega’s “Mambo No. 5”] [makes a loud farting noise] ♪ …gin and juice But I really don’t wanna… ♪ [makes loud farting noises] She fucking gives a noogie, gets a good fucking… And then she fucking, “Kobe!” Right into a little box for me. She goes, “Oooh!” [in high-pitched voice] “Nineteen to go, poopy surprise for Petey! Woo-hoo!” It’s my fantasy, and I’ll jerk off to it if I want to! [audience laughs] Tasty goes, “What do you want me to do?” I go, “Get rid of her!” “Keep one of those pairs.” Sorry. So now I got to get a restraining order, so that means I have to go to court. Tell a bunch of, you know, officials I’m afraid of this lady. So I’m at court, about to go in, Tasty comes back to me. He goes, “I just spoke to your girlfriend.” I go, “Fuck you!” You know? “What did she say?” You know? [audience laughs] He goes, “She’s not going to be able to be here today.” “She’s going to be on the iPad.” And I go, “What the fuck? What do you mean she won’t be here?” She’s a stalker, her job is to show up. What do you mean? Is she trying to get in my head or something? ‘Cause it’s working. It’s… I’m a little sad. You know, ’cause that… that dookie surprise was thoughtful. Though gross, you know. So I was a little excited to see her, a little bit, you know. I did',\n",
       "  'n’t try to look hot or anything, but I picked an outfit. You know, yeah. Hell yeah! You know? An outfit that said, like, “Hey.” “Don’t give up.” You know? [audience laughs] “Some things are worth fighting for.” Restraining order, shmestraining shorder. I go, “What happened, Tasty?” “What happened to my girl?” He goes, “Bro, she was deemed unfit to stand trial.” Deemed unfit to stand up at a trial. That means a bunch of medical professionals and officers of the law saw her and were like, “No.” I immediately felt insulted. It’s a little fucked up and embarrassing for me, don’t you think? “Deemed unfit”? I don’t think you understand how insane that is. Let me put it in perspective for you. Jeffrey Dahmer was deemed fit… [audience laughs] …to stand trial. A guy who murdered and ate gay people. One chick is into me, off to the nuthouse! [audience laughs] Are you fucking kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Killing and eating gays and poopy pants aren’t the same! First time in my life I was like, “I gotta vote!” [audience laughs] “System is corrupt.” Tasty goes, “There’s one more thing. She said you guys had been communicating.” I go, “Dude, I swear…” He goes, “Telepathically.” I was like, “Whew!” [exhales] Thought they found my burner. He goes, “Telepathically, you know.” “She said that you actually told her to come over with your mind.” I go, “Whoa, that’s fucked up.” And then he left, and I was alone, and I was a little sad, and I was in my cool outfit. I just had a moment of honesty, and I was just like… “Hello.” [audience laughs] “I miss you.” [chuckles] “You weren’t supposed to tell anybody that we could do this.” “Also you were supposed to kill Terry and my mom so we get the house.” “I got your panties in my pocket.” “Ziploc’ed to preserve the stench.” [laughs] So I go to trial, I win, you know, which is nice. I never win in life. [chuckles] Judge comes up to me, and he goes, “She fits the requirements for prison.” I go, “What?” He goes, “Do you want to send her to prison?” I go, “No, I just want her off my lawn.” Like Gran Torino, you know? “Get off my lawn!” [mumbles] But no big deal. Just… restraining order, you know? But restrain her to the upper deck, so she can still pay for shit. You know what I mean? Come to shows. He goes, “You don’t want her arrested?” I go, “No.” He goes, “That’s very noble of you.” I went, “Thank you, sir.” And then he goes, “We will do plan B then.” And he just smacks the hammer, and everybody’s… I was like, “Whoa, wait. What’s plan B?” He goes, “It’s nothing.” “We’re gonna sentence her to like six months, in a mental rehab facility.” I was like, “What? That’s not safe.” “That’s like the one place I’d bump into her.” [audience laughs] Might as well sentence her to Dave & Buster’s while you’re at it. Rehab’s like Cheers for me. It’s where everybody knows my name. A month went by, I got the restraining order. Didn’t really hit me till the first time I pulled up to my house, and no one was there. And I went, “Oh.” I was reminiscing with my mom. I was like, “Remember she’d be out there.” “Remember?” “Remember for Christmas once, she sent us all those cookies, and we made female Terry eat them first… [audience laughs] …to make sure they were good?” So I started missing her a little bit, you know. So once in a while, I’d be like, “Hello. Where are you?” And she wasn’t receiving my signals. So I made a finsta, and I started stalking her a little bit. I found her. She’s doing well. Seems to be for the best. You know, and I was scrolling through. You know, ’cause she’s a stalker, you don’t just stop stalking, right? You pick someone else, I assume, right? I was going through her Instagram, and I found out she’s a Jack Harlow fan now. And I like Jack, but that, that fucking hurt. That’s a fucking kick in the dick. I was like, “If you become a Matt Rife fan, I’ll kill myself.” I swear to God. [audience laughs] So I was watching it, I came across this video of her outside of a Jack Harlow show. Okay? And, uh, Jack Harlow comes out and she… I see her, I zoom in, and she’s wearing a Jack Harlow T-shirt. I guess she figured out how to do it ’cause he looked good in the photo. And I was like, “Oh…” “Oh. I was just practice.” Jack comes out, she goes, “I love you, Jack!” I went… [exhales] Even worse, Jack goes, “Hey, I love you, too.” Says her name. I went, “Oh…” “I bet that meant so much to her.” [exhales] I was calling her “the thing”. [audience laughs] I didn’t know. I didn’t know. Feel like I’m gonna throw up, watching this. Jack’s about to get in his vehicle to leave. She goes, “Hold on, Jack, I got a present for you.” I was like, “Oh, my',\n",
       "  ' God.” [chuckles] Got my… Guys, I felt like I was about to watch my girlfriend get fucked by my best friend. I was like, “No! No!” She goes into her backpack. And her arm gets deeper and deeper. I was like, “No, oh my God. What is it?” And then she pulls out an envelope. Hands it to Jack, goes, “I made that for you.” He goes, “Thanks so much.” Puts it in his jacket, drives off, video over, I log out. I start smiling to myself. Just an envelope, huh? [audience laughs] Ha! You can’t fit 20 pairs of dookie drawers in an envelope! Couple of legal disclaimers. So, she actually didn’t send me 20 pairs of underwear. She sent me two, but it smelled like 20, okay? She also did not become a Jack Harlow fan. I just made that up for hilarity. And three, and this is the most important, I did fuck her brains out. [audience laughs] [chuckles] I’m just kidding. I just ate her box. That’s it. I got super freaked out ’cause my address got out. So, I… I bought… I moved to the woods. [audience chuckles] It’s awesome. Um, I was looking for a house for a really long time, and my realtor really did not like me because… At first, she was excited. She was like, “You’re my first, you know…” I was like, “Okay.” You know. But she’d get annoyed because I saw like… This is not a joke, I saw, like, 200 houses. Eh, I wanted every one. I would cocktease… I’d be like, “This is gonna be it.” And then, you know… ‘Cause I would get excited. She hated me because it was taking so long, and I understood, but I’d get excited about every house ’cause I grew up in mostly just apartments. So every house was crazy to me. I’d be like, “Oh my God, a backyard. What the fuck?” “An above ground pool. How’d they get it out the ground? Oh my God.” “This must be one of them Frank Lloyd Wright houses.” I’d get intoxicated by words I never heard before. She’d be like, “This could be your foyer.” I’d be like, “Fuck yeah, it could. Yeah. Yeah.” “Foyer.” You know. Then there was this one house that I was like, “I’m going to get this house.” I knew I was going to get it, okay? I was with my boys and her, and she was really exhausted, ’cause she didn’t believe that I was going to pick one. But I said, “I really love this house.” All that was left to see eh, was the master bedroom. Which is now “the primary,” okay? At the time, I did not know it is now called the primary, okay? I thought it was “master bedroom.” I also didn’t know it was called the master bedroom because of slavery. I did not know that. I thought it was the master bedroom because, in life, when you buy a home, you, of course, become a master. [audience laughs] People come over, like, “Nice house.” You go, “Yeah, I’m a fucking master.” I don’t really think of slavery when I’m in houses, know what I mean? That’s all. You know. I don’t go, and I’m like, “Which one’s the slave room?” I’m not, “Show me the slave room!” So I love this house. I think I’m about to get it. I decide, like… It’s been a long time. I’m going to do a bit for my realtor. Make her laugh, you know. So there’s a coat rack in the living room. Okay, I grab it, and I go, “Show me the master bedroom!” [audience laughs] I know. My realtor, who was Black by the way… [audience laughs] …is speechless. She looks like she’s trying to tell me something, probably to stop. But I’m in full bit mode. So every time she goes… I go, “Don’t interrupt the master!” [audience laughs] “Show me my master bedroom!” “The room bigger than all the rooms, for I am the king.” My boys are on the floor dying laughing ’cause they’re racist. So they’re having the fucking best time. Finally, she grabs the coat rack and goes, “Stop!” She goes, “You got to stop. I’m trying to tell you it’s the primary bedroom.” “It’s not the master bedroom. It’s because of slavery.” “It’s a big deal about that now.” I was like, “Oh.” [audience laughs] My boys started slowly getting up, like… You know. And then she just handed me the coat rack. And it was quiet and awkward. I didn’t know what to do, but then I was thinking, you know, if I’ve learned anything in almost 15 years of comedy, it’s that you commit. [audience laughs] To the bit, yes. Especially, if it’s not working. So that’s what I did. I went, “You didn’t let me finish!” “We are all masters of our own rooms. It’s a figure of speech.” “Getting rid of slavery would have been my first decree.” “Upon further review, I will take this house!” “If you sign this NDA.” [audience laughs] “Perhaps in the primary foyer.” [audience laughs] So I live in the woods. [audience laughs] My mom made a fake Twitter account to defend me from trolls. [audience] Aww! “Aw.” It’s always “aw” when',\n",
       "  ' it’s not your mom. You ever realize that? When it’s someone else’s mom, “Aw.” When it’s your mom, you’re like, “Fuck you!” So she made this fake Twitter account to defend me online a couple years ago, okay? The username was JoeSmith1355, right? That’s very smart. That is not her name. But she’s a mom and doesn’t know how Twitter works. So the username might have been JoeSmith1355, but the profile name was Amy Davidson. [audience laughs] Icing on top, profile picture also Amy Davidson. Yes. [audience laughs] So I’m reading hate tweets one night while I masturbate to make myself stronger. [audience laughs] And I was scrolling through, and I see this one account defending me left and right. Back in the day, when you used Twitter on Safari, you didn’t see the profile name or picture, just the username. So I’m reading all these tweets, and people are being very mean. But JoeSmith1355, defending me left and right. I was reading all these nice tweets about me, JoeSmith1355. It was to the point, I was like, “This is why I do this.” “Thank you, JoeSmith1355.” You know? I was reading all these tweets, and then there was one tweet that was too specific, and I literally said out loud, “This is my mom.” [audience laughs] Which is a weird thing to say mid-jerk. [audience laughs] And then have to finish after that? “After this, I am going to call her.” I knew right away. This was the tweet. The hate tweet was, “Pete Davidson is gay.” JoeSmith1355 writes, “Actually, he’s not.” “He may have thought he was gay as a child because of Leonardo DiCaprio.” “Take a nap, hater.” [audience laughs] I call my mom. I go, “Joe Smith… 1355?” She goes, “What gave it away?” [audience laughs] I go, “Your profile name and picture are of you.” And she goes, “Oh! Terry!” [audience laughs] Which means my mom made a Twitter account with her 79-year-old female friend Terry, and Terry was calling the shots. Guys, thank you so much. That’s been a lot of fun.

       " ['“Roseanne Barr: Cancel This!” is a stand-up comedy special showcasing Roseanne Barr’s return to the stage, amid a backdrop of rock music and an enthusiastic audience. Barr’s routine is unapologetically controversial and provocative, a mix of personal anecdotes, political commentary, and observational humor that reflects her brash and unfiltered comedic style. She opens with a light-hearted jab at her fake nails and a brief prayer for mental clarity before diving into her material. Roseanne reminisces about her career beginnings in Houston, expressing gratitude and joking about the audience’s privilege to witness her performance. She navigates through topics like moving to Texas, gun rights, and the political divide within her family, labeling her daughters as “libtards” for their differing views. Her act then takes a more personal turn as she discusses her controversial firing from her television show, attributing it to a racially charged tweet that she insists was a result of misunderstanding and medication. She uses this to segue into broader criticisms of political correctness, media, and the entertainment industry. Throughout the special, Barr doesn’t shy away from contentious subjects, including politics, gender, and her own mental health, often using self-deprecation as a tool for humor. She also touches on her life changes post-controversy, including her newfound residence in Texas, her experiences with COVID-19, and her views on the vaccination efforts. Roseanne continues to delve into various societal and personal topics, like the absurdity she sees in modern parenting, her disdain for certain celebrity behaviors, and her struggles with aging. Throughout the performance, Barr maintains a conversational and interactive rapport with the audience, responding to their reactions and occasionally engaging directly with individuals. Her act is punctuated by raucous laughter, cheers, and at times, boos, reflecting the divisive nature of her material. The special concludes with Roseanne encouraging her audience to be forthright with their feelings, delivering a final, defiant message of self-expression. Premiere date:\\xa0February 2nd, 2023, on Fox Nation. * * * [rock music] [audience cheers] Look at these fake nails. Woo-hoo, look at that! I’m about to go on. I’m praying to god that he lets my brains work for once, And he protects me from myself. Ha-ha, ha-ha. Crew: We’re on our mark and ready to go. Have a great show. Thank you very much. Crew: Good luck. Welcome back. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Roseanne Barr. [intense music] [audience cheers] Hey! Thank you! Thank you very much. Hi! Thank you! [audience erupts in cheers] It’s so great to be here because I was thinking about it. You know, I kind of started my whole career here in Houston. Audience: We love you! I love you, too. What a privilege it is for you to have me here this evening, Ladies and gentlemen. [audience laughter and cheers] And, of course, I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I really do. Are you guys having fun or are you here with your families? [audience laughs] Mm. So let me take a quick rally of the troops here. Where are my peeps that are going to get really offended if I do not offend everybody? Where are my peeps here? [audience erupts in cheers] Oh, boy, good, there you are. There you are. Don’t worry. I’m going to get them all tonight. [audience applauds] That’s right. Well, guess what? I moved here to Texas, too. Isn’t that crazy? [audience cheers] I really did. My son– I don’t know, he’s somewhere– my oldest son, he’s somewhere here, and all my whole family’s here and the whole deal. Where is he? My oldest son, my youngest son, my grandson, my godson, my family’s here. None of my daughters are here because they– They don’t agree with me politically. They’re libtards, so they didn’t show up. But, uh– [audience cheers] But now I moved to Texas, and it’s Just beautiful because it’s a red state, and I love that. And, two, it’s just beautiful. I bought a beautiful ranch and what beautiful tundra We have here in Texas. Like, I look out my bedroom window. I can’t believe it. I see all these gorgeous little tiny baby deer in my yard, eating the grass around my pool. It’s so fantastic, you know, because I can pull out my AR-15 and blow them just to smithereens legally. [audience cheers] So fantastic! Open carry, bitches! Hell, yeah! [audience erupts in cheers] Ha-ha, hell, yeah. Anyways, anybody else been fired recently? [audience cheers] Audience: Woo! Ooh, well, we’ll talk about that a little. Ahem. For the people that have been fired, were you able to keep your insurance? Audience: No! Audience: No! Yeah, it’s kind of scary. I– I was able to keep my insurance. Thank god. But then I started getting real– real nervous because my family, my sons and stuff, they’re looking at m',\n",
       "  'e weird, like, that maybe I’m worth more dead than alive, you know. I don’t know. I get kind of paranoid about it because I watch the ID channel. And what with my big mouth and everything, well, anyway, my two sons and my grandson and my godson, they’re all here kind of to watch over me, to make sure me and my big mouth don’t squander no more of their inheritance, I guess is what they’re here for. [audience applauds] Man, I had a rough couple of years there. I got fired because basically I racially misgendered somebody I thought was a white woman. [audience laughs] Audience: Woo! Audience: Bullshit. Huh? Audience: I thought that bitch was white. I know, I thought the bitch was white. It’s true! [audience cheers] They wouldn’t– they wouldn’t let me explain. I don’t– here it was Memorial Day, you know. And I was at my mom’s house in Salt Lake City, Utah, And it was memorial day. And I should say, I barely could sleep anymore because the network was running me ragged, making me do promos, which I hate. You know what I mean? I’d rather die than do effing promos, not the ones that Fox is asking me to do. [audience laughs] I’m more than happy to do those. But I could never sleep because they had me Go to New York, LA, New York. That’s why I couldn’t sleep. I’m an old woman, 68. So they told me, oh, try some Ambien, you know, so I did. I got on the Ambien on top of all my psycho drugs Because I’m crazy. I’ll just be honest. I’m completely crazy. [audience erupts in cheers] Oh, thank you. You are, too, I see. Thank you. No, but I’ve been on psycho meds and bipolar meds And antipsychotic drugs my whole damn life, right? It was no big deal to me. I shouldn’t have mixed it with Ambien and then topped it off with three beers, though. I have to admit. I should not have did that. That caused me to lose everything. And so what happened, it’s about 1:00 am. And I don’t have such good eyesight. You may have read about that, and Somebody sent across a picture. And it’s about 1:00 am there, and so I Captioned it and passed out. And then I woke up– [audience laughs] At 7:00 am, and the whole goddamn world was on fire. [audience laughs] My boyfriend came in there. He goes, oh, my god, it’s on cnn that your tweet was racist. I’m, like, what are you talking about, “my tweet was racist.” Muslim ain’t a race. [audience laughs] He goes, no, they’re saying she’s– She’s African-American. I was, like, oh, shit. [audience laughs] Oh, shit, no. “yeah, and ABC is on the phone. They want to talk to you.” I’m, like, oh, shit, I don’t want To talk to no Hillary donors. [audience laughs] After all I’ve been through on that show, you know, So I get on there. And the guy, you know, you can imagine. Oh, here’s how the phone call starts. (over-enunciating) “what possible– Excuse– Can you have– For the egregious– Thing you have done?” You know, and then just god and my upbringing comes in my head. And it’s, like, just tell the truth, Roseanne. You’ve always got to tell the truth, right? Tell the truth. The truth will set you free. You know what I’m talking about, ma’am? So I’m, like, you’re right, father. I’m just going to tell the truth. “I thought she’s white.” [audience laughs] It’s like total silence. [audience laughs] So I start tap dancing, you know as you do When you know you’re in shit. [audience laughs] I’m, like, hey, don’t do nothing to my show, ok? Don’t– don’t cancel me or do nothing to my show, fire me, nothing like that. I’ll tell you what. Just put me on “The Jimmy Kimmel Show” And on “The View” and a lot of your other shows You’ve got on the ABC channel, you know, where people, they’ve been in blackface and everything. I’ll go on there, and surely they’ll understand my mistake. [audience moans and cheers] Because surely they didn’t get fired for that shit. And they’ll understand when people Do something really stupid. And, uh, so, no, they said, “Well, Roseanne, we’ll have To see how the community”– That’s what he said– “we’ll have to see How the community reacts.” [audience boos] Yeah, and in my mind, I was thinking, what community. [audience laughs] The, uh, baby blood-drinking democrat community or, uh– [audience erupts in cheers] Or the protect Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Prince Andrew community? Which community exactly are you talking about? [audience cheers] But I didn’t say it because, at that time, I was thinking it was more important to be nice. [audience laughs] So I walk in, and it’s on CNN that they’ve canceled my show just 20 minutes later. And not only that, but they killed my– they killed, uh, Roseanne. They killed her. [audience boos] Yeah. Yeah, I guess they thought they shut me up. But guess what? Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha, anyway– [audience erupts in cheers] Yeah, I didn’t really care at that time because I couldn’t sit in them writing rooms with those people one more second. I wasn’t re',\n",
       "  'ally that pissed what they did to me. But, you know, I was really mad what they did to my fans because they disrespected their own viewers, you know. [audience cheers] Like, we could have– we could have had her come on my show, and she could have read me the who’s it. And she could have dressed me down. We could have had a teachable moment that they’re all talking about. She could have come on. I could have had 15 times the ratings, And I could have learned something on behalf and shown something to America, which I always wanted to do that very thing anyway, bringing people together and learn about each other, right? When we have made mistakes for– Because we can learn. We can learn to get along for gods sake. [audience applauds] But, no, they didn’t want to do that, and that pissed me off. And that’s why I came back, even though I was, like, why would you want to do that after what they did. But I came back because I just– something’s wrong with me or something. I just– something’s in me. I just cannot let assholes win. I’m not. I’m not going to. [audience erupts in cheers] I’m not going to. [audience cheers] I am not going to let rich, privileged assholes win. I’m not! [audience erupts in cheers] And, you know, looking back, I believe that I actually Got fired because I delivered an audience– An unbelievable audience of 28 million people to a show that had a trump hater and a Hillary hater still loving each other, still living under the same roof as a family, still being American. And, by god, they hated that! [audience cheers] But whatever, it’s all in the past now. It was a weird– It’s been, like, five years or something. It was a weird five years. We’ve all been through some shit in the last five years, right, the whole country. We’ve all been through some shit in the last five years. Well, imagine my surprise when my agent called and said Fox Nation was offering me a big contract to do a stand-up special. Imagine my shock. [audience erupts in cheers] I was shocked. I was happy but shocked. They sent along a contract and said, hey, we want you to do an hour or so of material but no racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, anti-semitism. I go, well, there goes my whole fucking act. What– what? [audience applauds] And they said and we want you to do very few swear words as well. [audience laughs] But that– that– the f-word I just used, ladies and gentlemen, is one of three times tonight I will be using the f-word because my lawyers were able to go in and wrangle a three f-word deal out of the Fox Nation’s lawyers. [audience laughs] And I accepted because it’s kind of a challenge for me. I’ve never done an hour of comedy before with only using the f-word three times. I thought, hey, this is a chance to try something new. [audience laughs] Never done it before so. Audience: We love you! I love you. You’re sweet. [audience cheers] Thank you so much for coming to see me tonight. Any Jews here tonight? [audience cheers] Wow, a lot of Jews, that’s pretty amazing. Hi. Hi, Jewish people. There’s probably a lot more Jews, But they’re kind of ashamed to raise their hand. [audience laughs] Yeah, I don’t blame you. I’m lucky. Nobody ever thinks I’m Jewish because I’m from Utah. Audience: No more bitches with stitches. We all get to open our mouths. Huh? Audience: No more bitches with stitches. We get to open our mouths. That’s right. We do but shut up, bitch. But, anyway– [audience erupts in cheers] I mean– I mean– I mean, right on, sisterhood. But, anyway, no, but, no, it’s kind of embarrassing to be a jew. And I would like to take this opportunity to kind of apologize to the gentile nations for the Jewish people. Like, you know, like, Epstein, Weinstein, and all these here. Sorry. I am a jew, and people don’t think I’m Jewish because I’m not from the East Coast or nothing. I’m from Salt Lake City, Utah. Audience: Woo! Any Mormons here? Audience: Yes! Hi, Mormons. Love ya. I grew up with Mormons. That was a weird place to be Jewish, though, Salt Lake City, Utah. Boy, my family, we stuck out like a sore thumb there in Mormon Utah, you know, because we only had the one mother, and so that was weird. [audience laughs] She had to do all the mothering by herself. That was kind of rough on her. And my mother was the most beautiful Jewish woman In the Jewish community. That’s what everybody said all the time. They were, like, she looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That’s what everybody said, and she had a gorgeous figure, you know, my mother. And she managed to snare the one Jewish football hero at West Side High School, which was my daddy. He was a football hero there. He played center at West Side High, and he was a big old football hero. And they called him Jerry Barr, the boy built like a barrel. [audience laughs] So they were quite a couple. And they had me and guess whose body I inherited. [aud',\n",
       "  'ience laughs] Not my mother’s but my dad, the body built like a barrel, With no waist and no ass cheeks whatsoever. It’s very sad, very sad for a girl. I had no ass whatsoever. I’m telling you the truth. Just a crack in my back is basically what I had. It’s very sad for my– nobody wanted to date me. Plus, my mother and father were very concerned that I would never find a husband because I was fat and had a bad attitude and a big mouth. I mean, they were really– [audience laughs] They were really overly concerned about that I’d never get a husband. That was my whole life. You’re never going to get a husband Unless you go on a diet. I mean, no guy is ever going to want to marry you, What, with you having no tuchus– That’s what they’d say– no hips, no buttocks, no waist, and a big mouth. And you’re always in trouble, and you’re really fat, You know, and nobody likes that kind of thing, you see. So you’ve got to go on this. They put me on so many diets, the rice Diet, the birdseed diet. They put me on every damn diet, and none of them worked. Finally, my mom said she’s going to– she finally got a guy for me to date, and I was suspicious Right away. She’s, like, I found a wonderful gentleman– She called him– in the Jewish community That I think you’ll be– You’ll be happy to know is interested in dating you. So right away, I’m suspicious, right? So she goes, so I don’t know if this rings true for any of you. Probably not because it’s a whole different culture, I know. But the first thing that went in my mind is– I don’t know if this happened to you, if this is familiar– is, like, “um, mom, we’re not related to him, are we?” [audience laughs] Does that ring true for any of y’all? Audience: Yeah. And by the way, she answered– because it took Her a long time to answer– I knew that we were related, you know. And it was Stu Bernstein, that big fat guy, that big fat slob Of the Bernstein family. And all of them had eyes that went like this, Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah. The whole family’s eyes, wah-wah, wah-wah, they never Stood still, none of their eyes, you know. And they were fat, not that I should say Nothing about fat but the eyes. And, plus, he’s a chronic masturbator, Which I guess he thought– He thought we didn’t see it or nothing. The guy, he thought he was disguising it, but I knew what he’s up to, you know. He’d go like this. “well, let’s all go down to the Dairy Queen there and get ourself an ice cream.” [audience laughs] “what do you say?” Sitting there on the couch or standing up, whatever, It’s always, like, “well, let’s go over to Safeway There and pick ourself up”– I knew what he was doing. So I’m, like, no, I’m not. I’m not, you know. [audience laughs] So she said, “Well, you’ve got to go on a diet Then if you want to.” So she took me to this diet guy. This is, I swear to god, true on my kids’ lives. I’m 16, and I’m fat. So we’re out there. We’re waiting in the waiting room. And she waits till the last minute, my mom, to tell me, “Oh, Roseanne, by the way, the doctor is blind”– [audience laughs] –“and how he tells how much weight you need to lose is by feeling your body.” [audience laughs] I swear to god. So I’m in shock. So we go in there, and he rolls over In a wheelchair because not only is he blind But he can’t walk neither. He’s a mess, nothing but mess. And he rolls over there and starts going like this. “mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, oh, mm-hmm.” And he does my boobs, too. “mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I’d say there’s about 40 pounds of you That you need to release.” “Thanks, doctor.” So he fixes it up that I go in there every day– I swear to god this is true– and I get a shot of urine from a pregnant horse. Have any of y’all heard of that? Urine from a pregnant horse, well, it makes your what’s-it speed up. What’s that, son? Audience: Metabolism. Your metabolism speed up, so you start losing weight, and I did. I lost a ton of weight. I lost so much weight that I got pregnant by the neighbor guy, so that was good. [audience cheers] Anyway, that’s another sad story. But, yeah, I was kind of cute at that time, then I left home. I had all these fantasies living at home there, living at home Where I was just, you know, my mom’s Ugly daughter that stood in the corner chewing on my hair. But, uh, I don’t know what I’m talking about. Oh, yeah, so I was kind of a loner. I had all these fantasies. I didn’t have no friends or nothing, mostly in my room, living in my imagination. Number one, I wanted to grow up, leave Utah, of course. Two, I wanted to get out there and get my pork on because we were not allowed to have any pork in my house. I wanted to move away, so I could take birth control pills so that I would be able to have indiscriminate sex With everyone– every guy I ever met– and to get my own show, named “The Roseanne Show.” And I’m so proud to say that I was ',\n",
       "  'able to make all of those dreams come true, ladies and gentlemen. [audience erupts in cheers] Thank you for the validation. [audience cheers] But, anyway, due to the spam and my love of spam, which has never subsided, I think that’s a large reason for why I moved to Hawaii, which I still live in Hawaii. Now I’m, like, half Hawaii, half Texas, which is cool. [audience cheers] I love Hawaii. It’s a fantastic place. But one thing we say over there, it is quite a short trip from Aloha to a-hole. It’s quite a short trip sometimes over there. And, yeah, yeah, spam, that evens it all out. You probably read about me having macular degeneration and losing my eyesight and all that, right? So the fact of it is I could grow weed over there in Hawaii, And that really helps me with my eyesight things, right? [audience cheers] It is such a good medication, and that’s another thing. When I ran for president, I ran on legalization of marijuana Because it’s a good, good drug. [audience erupts in cheers] Right? It really helps you if you have anxiety issues, which I do, Because I get very anxious when I think I might run out of pot. So it’s a very good treatment for that kind of thing. And you know what? The marijuana, it does help me with my driving Since I can’t see too good. And, well, I probably shouldn’t even drive is the bottom line There since I can’t see. And, yes, it’s true. I have hit a few people. But, you know, luckily, I was not hurt, so it all worked out. But– but one day, my kids were coming over, And I haven’t really talked about my kids too much. I have five of them. And, you know, my kids are probably like your kids. They’re ungrateful, privileged, little fucking bastards That have never had to work a day in their life for anything. [audience cheers] You know, and they’re too good for cheese. My kids are too damn good for regular cheese. So I was going over there to the health food store to get them this soy cheese because they’re too good for real cheese, you see. So, anyway, I move on. I go over there, and I pull in. And some lady is sitting in her car, looking over at me. And I had a couple of shots before I came to the store, you know, to help me with my focus and this and that. And she looks over, and I’m, like, ah, god, I’m going to have to act like I’m nice because she probably recognized me or some shit. So now I’m acting like I’m nice, which I do all the time. It’s the least I can do. [chuckles] [audience laughs] [audience cheers] So she looks over at me, and she’s, like, you– you hit me. You hit me with your car, your fender. I’m, like, I didn’t hit you, bitch. What are you talking about? This is a Tesla. If I was going to hit you, it would have made some kind of a beeping noise, you know, that Tesla is prepared for hitting things, and it warns you. I didn’t hit you, you crazy bitch. And I said, you know what you’re doing? You just know I’m in show business, so you smell some money. That’s what you’re doing, right? Do you see where I’m going with this? A lot of people are like that. I go, you smell money because I’m in show business. You thought you can start some shit with me, and I have to give you a settlement. And that’s what you’re doing. You’re not the first, and you’re probably not going to be the last. She goes, “That is not true, Roseanne. I’ll have you know”– [audience cheers] She goes, “I will have you know that I am also in show business, ok? The last 24 years, I was Bette Midler’s dresser. I’ll have you know that.” [audience laughs] I’m, like, “Yeah, well, blowing cocaine up Bette Midler’s asshole is not show business, is it?” [audience cheers] Then she moves in for the kill. “I think you’re driving around drunk, Roseanne.” I said, “I’ll have you know, I am an actress, and I know how to maintain. You are an anti-semite. That’s what’s wrong with you,” because that’s what we Jews do when we’re losing an argument, right? “you are an anti-semite.” [audience cheers] She goes, “My name is Goldberg.” I’m, like, “Well, then I’m an anti-semite.” [audience applauds] And I sped away in my Tesla home. When I went in, I noticed the front fender was all smashed in. [audience laughs] Ooh, uh-oh. Can you believe that it has been two or three years since we was all in the quarantine? Can you believe back that far? I’m glad you’re out. I’m glad we can come out. [audience cheers] What about all that quarantine? Remember all that? You know, I figured out q, q, it stands for quarantine. It wasn’t any of that who’s going to get arrested bullshit. It stands for quarantine. Q, the great awakening, you know why? Because you had to be with your goddamn family in the house, and you couldn’t get out of there. You couldn’t go to the gym. You couldn’t go to a restaurant. You couldn’t get away. You couldn’t go to nobody else’s house. You were stuck there in the shit with your friggin’ famil',\n",
       "  'y and couldn’t get away. That’s why they say the great awakening. You had to deal with that shit, and you couldn’t run anymore. [audience laughs] Dang. I was smoking a lot of cigarettes at the beginning of the quarantine there. After getting fired, I started smoking again, And I love to smoke. But my kids ganged up on me. They’re, like, “You better quit smoking, mom, because you’re going to get COVID. And then you’re going to have to go to the hospital, and they’ll put them things down your throat and kill you, like they do in New York. You better quit smoking.” So I did quit smoking. And you know what happened soon as I quit smoking? Soon as I quit, I got the COVID the minute I quit smoking. And then I read that cigarette smoking actually protects you from getting the COVID. That’s when I knew everything was bullshit. [audience cheers] It’s all bullshit and nothing but lies, every single damn thing. [audience cheers] I’ve had the COVID four times now, and I lost all my taste. I have no taste and no smell either all this time. But I look at it like it’s a silver lining in the COVID cloud because I don’t eat so much. I’m not wanting to eat everything, And it don’t taste that good so I lost some weight. Thanks, lord. [audience laughs] Once I got the COVID, though, and saw that my kids weren’t going to come over, I was, like, man, I’m going to get the long COVID. [audience laughs] I’m going to get that COVID that never quits. Woo, it’s wonderful. It’s like living in a rest home is what it was like there. I had an assistant that cooked for me and brought me tea, And none of my family ever came over. Oh, my god, it was so great. It was the first time in my life that I haven’t had to take care of nobody’s kids or do their goddamn laundry Or get out of bed and do shopping for or any of that shit. I just laid there in bed talking to god and writing jokes. It was fantastic. [audience erupts in cheers] I did not want my grandkids coming over, ’cause they’re always sick. And they make me sick all the time. My daughter thinks it’s good that they’re sick. Your mom thinks it’s good that the kids are sick. It would always drive me nuts. She goes, it’s good they’re sick because they’re developing Their anti– What do you call it? [audience shouting] Yeah, their immunity. They’re getting their immunities. It’s good that they’re sick. Yeah, well, I’m 70. What about my immunities, bitch? You bring over these kids with the green snot in their nose, And it takes me a month to get over it. Stay home. I’ll watch them on Facetime. Right? It was so much better. It was just great. How many yous got the vax? [laughs] [clapping] A few of yous. You probably had to get it, right? Were you forced to get the vax? Yeah. Boy, what a– that makes me mad, they Forced people to get the vax. I hope they have to pay for that, what they did to us. Woman: Yeah! Did you get any of that myocarditis, Or the facial paralysis, or, you know, The adult dropping dead syndrome or any of that shit? Get any of that? What happened to people that they start believing, For some reason, that this government had their best interest at heart? Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! What? What? My whole family’s bunch of libtards, you know, as I said. And they called me a conspiracy theorist the whole time, But everything I said turned out to be true. Did they apologize? Hell no! They never apologize. Never admit they’re wrong, do they? Now, my whole family is sick, what with blood clots and this And that and the other. They’re all sick. I’m the only healthy one. I’m gonna miss ’em! [audience laughter] What happened to people, though? How could they line up to take these shots From this government, knowing that this government gave Smallpox-infested blankets to the first nations people, Gave syphilis to black prisoners in Tuskegee, Told us there was weapons of mass destruction Before they leveled Iraq and destroyed Libya, told us fen-phen was safe and then all The fucking fat people died? What happened? And they’re like, hey, can I get that booster? Can I get that shot in those 15 boosters? Would you mind giving my daughter here That shot right in her eyeball after she’s born? Could you give her 10 of those right in the eyeball? Could you give her a shot right in her little baby clitoris? Could you do that for me, Mr. Biden? What’s wrong with people? What’s wrong with them? These young pink pussy hat wearers, They want to be lied to. They want to be lied to because they are so used to it. You can’t wake them up, because you can’t wake up people that Are pretending to be asleep. That’s what I figure. Nobody– [audience cheers and applauds] Nobody in their lives has ever cared enough to tell them The damn truth. It’s our fault, us baby boomers. We ruin their lives. We lied to them all away. We lie to women, ruin their lives. For example, my',\n",
       "  ' son, he’s 27 years old. I’m very proud of him. He’s the only one of my children who ever went to college And graduated. I couldn’t be more proud. [audience cheers] But what does he do with it? Just sits there in my office, took over my office. I can’t even walk in my office, what With the empty beer cans and the dirty socks. And all he does is sit there playing video games all night long every night. “Call of Duty.” What’s that other one? Audience: “Fortnite.” “Fortnite,” “Call of Duty.” And what’s that other one? [audience shouting] “Grand Theft Auto.” That’s his whole life, for god’s sake, Sitting there, asking me stupid questions I have no idea how to answer. Who’s my real father? What am I supposed to say about things like that? I mean, these people, they have no concept of reality. They’ve been living in a bubble forever, Asking questions that have nothing To do with the real world. What is my gender? Mom, what is my gender? Your gender is, get a job. That’s your gender. What are they thinking? Ask, what is a woman? They don’t know that? But when they’re asking all the time, what is a woman? I’ll tell you what a woman is, a woman is me! [audience cheers] That’s what a woman is, ok? A woman is someone who cleans up everybody else’s shit! That’s what a woman is. A woman is somebody whose boobs hang down to her knees With a prolapsed uterus from giving birth to five Ungrateful little privileged bastards that Have never had to work for anything In their whole damn lives! [audience cheers] [laughs] My pronouns are kiss my ass! [audience cheers] And I just want to say to all those girls That are all so damn upset about them Overturning the “Roe v Wade” thing, don’t get so damn upset about it! You are never gonna get pregnant. You’ve got the vax! You’re never gonna have a baby. Chill out! Yeah. I do have a message for today’s women. I’m trying to get a Kleenex out of this pocket. There it is. I do have a message for today’s women. I think it’s important. Women, keep your penis in your pants. There’s no excuse for this kind of behavior. In this day and age, take some responsibility For your own actions, women. These #metoo whores, they are so on my last nerve. You know what I mean? If you are gonna go to a Disney producer’s room at 3:00 am, Are you kidding me? Then you’re not gonna turn around and cry about it And try to get some money out of it. You’re not. The world has changed a lot since I was alive. I’m telling you, it’s changed so much. When I was young, we gals used to go to parties hoping to get Drunk so we’d wake up pulling a train of five guys just For fun. And nobody thought anything about it. It was no big deal. You know what I mean? Remember when you were young and you got molested? It is your fault. Remember that? Remember? My mom’s like, didn’t I tell you not to go around old Joe when he comes to the corner on his bike? I told you to stay away from him. You know what he does to the young girls. And there you are, running up there to the corner, Knowing what he is going to do to you, And then you complain about it. He buys us ice cream! We didn’t do yoga stretches. Do you know what I mean? We didn’t drink caramel pumpkin latte “mah-chi-ah-to,” White woman caramel drinks. We didn’t do that. We drank tab and fresca and shit that had saccharin in it. They gave us liver cancer, and we were happy to have it, ’cause we were tough, unlike you people, you young people. Privileged. Just privileged. That’s what I realized in quarantine. Privilege really kills. Privilege is what ruins lives, when You start thinking, you know, that the world Needs to be pretty for you. Well, it don’t. Right? Just because you got a degree in gender studies, That don’t mean shit. You’re not gonna get a job no place. You can’t even get a job at Whole Ho Ho’s donuts. Didn’t I tell you that? I told you. Privilege kills and bliss is ignorance. I turn those around. Bliss is ignorance, right? I have three different litters of children. Oh, I say that. I had three different litters with three different men Because I’m a whore. You know what I mean, ladies. And parenting has changed so much, too, since, you know, back in my day. It’s changed so much. Who else has teenagers in their 50s? Yeah, I have three daughters. I told you they’re very liberal, but they’re In their late 40s and 50. Three daughters in menopause. That’s when you know you’re old. For god’s sake, that’s when you know you’re old, right? I can’t believe how fast it went, too. Oh, my god. They tell me, you know, the things they come up with now. They’re like, mom, the doctor, they want us to take Testosterone for our symptoms. They are trying to give everybody crazy ass hormones From the time they’re two all the way up, Giving women testosterone to treat Their perimenopause is insane. I’m like, great. Now you’ll be lifting weights and watching ',\n",
       "  'football. I wouldn’t take it if I was you. That’s just asking for trouble, you know, Because your IQ is gonna decrease by half. And then you’re gonna just start peeing on toilet seats For no good reason whatsoever. It’s just, I don’t think it’s– I don’t think it’s good. But I kind of think maybe I shouldn’t have left the democrat party so early, what with their full-term abortion stuff they’re doing these days. Because I’m thinking, hey, another couple of months, They’re probably gonna move right into, I’d be able to abort these bitches by the time they’re 50. I bet they’re gonna move right into it. You know, I mean, it’s coming. That’d be cool. So things aren’t what they seem. Like, my brother and my sister are both gay. I’ve mentioned that before. And both of them are married to their gay partners That they’ve both been with for 34 and 35 years, which is Pretty amazing, considering– [audience cheers] Yeah. It’s great. They’ve raised children. And you know, I’m heterosexual and I’ve been married 9 or 10 Times, so you can’t ever be– You know, go with the stereotype for things. But they’re progressive parents, though, And I can’t stand that, progressive parents. I can’t stand it. It don’t make any sense, you know, the way they just let Their kids get away with shit. They just, like a rubber band, stretch it to the end. You know? My sister, she never quite puts the hammer down on her. She has twin lesbian daughters that are– That’s what I call them. They’re not really lesbians. But they’re, like, 21. She never really put the hammer down. They could get away with anything, you know? Not like my kids. I really– you know, I’m there, on top of my kids. My kids can’t get away with anything that I know about. But yeah. She’s like, I’m going to count to five, Like that some big threat. You know? Woman: Yeah. [laughs] You know, I mean, that progressive. 1, 2, 3? I’m like, you’ve got to hit these bitches! If you want them to do right, you’ve got to hit ’em. You’ve got to hit your kids. I have to say that. We need to hit ’em more. And why has it fallen to me to be The person to have to hit everybody’s Kids in the grocery store? Why has that fallen to me? But there they are in the grocery store. Their mom will pay no attention to them because she’s too busy photographing her ass– [audience laughter] –For her Instagram page, where the kids are running wild. It just really gets me. It’s like, why did you have them? Now I’m, like, kind of on a bender about it. So of course, I’m gonna hit ’em. You know, I’m gonna have to. Somebody has to. What are you gonna do, go over there? Hey, stop doing that. That ain’t right. Didn’t your mother tell you that? Keep your hands off stuff, and don’t stick your nasty fingers Through the plastic. Do you understand me? And I’m like, ma’am? Ma’am? Did it ever occur to you when you had these little bastards That you were gonna bring them to a public place Where other people would have to care for them while you Took pictures of your ass? It just gets me. It really gets me, as I’m jealous of anyone who Has an ass, well, first of all, because I Was born ass-less in an ass-based economy And I’m bitter about it. I never thought I would see the day when a woman goes into her husband and says, Honey, do these pants make my ass look fat enough? There’s no men left in our country. Have you noticed that? All the men, they want to be women, Or else they’re just complete pussies and losers. Have you noticed that? There’s no men with any kind of spine left. They’ve all been beaten down. What happened to the men? Are there any men here tonight who would define their self? [audience cheers] Oh, sure. Really? Ok. Well, let’s take this little test. You think you’re a man, huh? You think you’re strong, yeah? Mr. Man, well, let’s see. I defy any of you men who say you’re strong and manly And this and that. Well, I defy you to go home tonight and tell Your wife or girlfriend that she needs To sit down and shut her yap. Tell her you need to sit down and shut Up and get off every other woman in the world’s case. Stop bitching about every other woman And trying to stir up shit for them. Close your mouth and make me a sandwich. Things would be a lot better. Am I right? And I bet none of yous will do it, either. None of yous will do it because you’re scared shitless. I know it. Women are– I don’t know. Something has happened to women, and they’re just All completely brainwashed. We’ll do anything for dick, anything for dick. What happened? We used to like freedom and liberty and this and that And being independent. Now, it’s anything for dick, putting plastic in your boobs, In your butt, in your calves, your eyes, your cheeks, Just to get some guy to get, what, an erection around you, For god’s sake? Dancing around erect phalluses? That’s your whole world, for god’s sake, now? You’re dick-mo',\n",
       "  '-tized. You’re dick-tarted, for Christ’s sake? What is that about? You’re on hormones. Wake up. They’ve got all the women on the hormones because– This is what they told me. Roseanne, unfortunately, the only thing thin on you Is your vaginal walls, and so you need to get on hormones so That they’ll plump up and you’ll be able to enjoy Sex with your boyfriend. What? Those days are over! It– it’s just over. You shouldn’t even– right? You people don’t agree with me. Who’s older than me? Who’s older than 70? Kathy: Yeah! How old are you? Kathy: 71. 71. What’s your name? Kathy: Kathy. Kathy? So you’re a big sex fiend. You’re 71 and you’re a big sex fiend? Is that what you’re saying? Kathy: Not at all! Oh, you are– You identify with me, that we ought to be over all this? Is that what you’re saying? Absolutely! I love you, girl! You got a working brain there. Good. I’m glad. Now, how many of you women are trying to plump up Your vaginal wall so you can have sex with a guy You have lived with for 15 years and are sick of? I’d like to know that. [audience laughs] Woman: Yes, that’s for certain! Woman: Whoo! Woman: Shit. Well, anyway, I’m old, like I said. And I was thinking about, a lot of people have a bucket list. You know? I don’t really want to bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower or any of that shit. I got a fuck it list. Yeah, stuff I want to stop doing before I Kick the breathing habit. It’s way easier, you know, to stop doing. Like, one thing I’m gonna do is, I’m going to stop pretending To be interested when old people pull out Pictures of their grandkids. You know? Like, put that shit away. That kid looks like an albino monkey in braces. Put that shit away. I’m never going to nobody’s wedding if they’ve been married more than three times. It’s like, let me know if you’re still together After seven or so years, and I’ll send you A toaster or something, whore. I’m not gonna listen when old people start griping About their medical issues. That really bum– god, that makes me mad. Well, Roseanne, you know, I’ve got the sciatica and the fibromyalgia Going this way and that, meeting up here at the waist, going down my leg here. And it’s really painful, and I can barely– Oh, I had to go to the doctor the other day Because I could barely bend over and move there, is all. Hey, why don’t you do me a favor and just die, already? Ok? ’cause I’m their friend, I’ll put in an appearance at your funeral, But I just don’t have time for this shit now. Another thing, I’m not gonna be nice to those Jehovah’s Wit-less people that come over there, knocking on my door, Asking me where I plan on spending eternity. I’m gonna say, come on in! Come on. But you got to take your pants off ’cause it’s satan’s birthday! And last but not least, I’m never going on another date with Bill Cosby. You can believe me. Never. My back hurt after that. Well, another thing in the quarantine, Is that I was getting in touch with my psychic abilities While I was there, all by myself there. And so I know there’s probably some yous here that wants me to do a psychic reading for you While we’re all here together. Woman: Yeah! If you’ve got a question about your future– And it needs to be a real question, You know, thought out. I’ll give you a minute. A real question regarding your future.

Now, a lot of us are on antidepressants. And we’re very depressed and this and that Over the quarantine and the fact of what they’ve done to us, What we’ve just lived through. But I found a way, drug-free, alcohol-free, To be able to lift my own spirits, And I want to pass it on to you. And it really, really works, too. Now, what it is– What I do is, I write suicide notes to everyone in my family, Blaming them for my death. And it really helps. I mean, it really lifts me up in my spirits. You know, it really, really does. It’s so wonderful. “dear mom, remember those party dresses you sewed for me And forced me to wear to third grade Because you said they were slender-izing, The ones with the hoop skirts that I couldn’t lift up fast Enough or push out of the way on the potty, Causing me to pee on the back of them And then to be laughed at by all the other students The entire day? Well, now it seems that I’ve killed myself, And I just want you to know that you’re to blame. [audience laughs] Had you been a better mother or seamstress, I might be taking those western swing dancing classes with you and your new boyfriend, Arnie, right now. But instead, I’m stepping cold and hanging in the closet Like that goddamn dress. Thanks, mom!” [applause] It’s just– it’s just amazing how it’s lifting. “dear daughter, when you called me a racist simply Because I told you that your boyfriend was An unemployed, crack-smoking Mexican fellow, that in no way meant that I don’t love the Mexican people themselves, As I do. As I pointed out to you, you could have picked A Mexican gentleman who didn’t smoke crack, had a job, and no facial tattoos, and I would have celebrated with you. But now, I’m rolled up in the dirt like a burrito, And it’s your fault I’m dead. Hasta la vista, baby.” And something that really, really pisses me off here. “dear McDonald’s, your refusal to offer the McRib sandwich Year-round–” Because you never know when it’s gonna come back, do you? You think they could afford some kind of advertising plan Where they’d say, the McRib that comes on July 4th. July is the time for the McRib. Or they could go, Christmas is for the McRib or just anything. But no, they never tell us when it’s gonna come back, do they? So we can’t plan our lives or anything. “dear McDonald’s, refusal to offer the McRib sandwich Year-round has left me with no other choice Than to wash down a fistful of Vicodin with a jumbo bottle of vodka from Costco. Because you, sirs, have barbecue sauce as well as my blood On your hands. And I’m loving it!” [audience laughs] [applause] And finally, “dear abc–” [audience laughs] Oh. [audience cheers] But as I was watching the ID channel, This commercial came on, you know. And it goes, “sometimes suicide is misplaced homicide.” And then I was like, hey. That gives me a whole new idea. What the hell here? “dear ABC, when you asked me, once again, to come back And bail out your shit, low-rated network, I did so with the same sass and vigor That I’ve always delivered, and I gave you the highest ratings You’ve seen in 10 years. Unfortunately, network executives Are not what they used to be. It was your bright idea to kill off my character And throw me under every bus that you could find. Well, guess what? I’m not the one that’s dead, bitches.” [audience cheers] Ladies and gentlemen, my final message of the evening. Don’t wait till it’s too late to tell the people you love How you really feel about them. I think that’s the message I really want to give to you all. Tonight, go home tell those you love to fuck off right now. [audience cheers] Thank you for coming. Thank you. [audience cheers] Love you. Thank you so much.

       " ['In this humorous and politically charged stand-up segment, comedian Sammy Obeid shares his family’s geographical connections to religious and historical sites like Jerusalem and Bethlehem, while playfully navigating the complex geopolitics of the region. He delves into the confusion surrounding the actual location of Bethlehem, offering a comedic historical rundown from the Roman Empire to the present day, poking fun at political borders and international relations. His routine also touches on the divisive nature of political comedy, recounting an interaction with a critical audience member and concluding with a light-hearted but poignant commentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Published on YouTube, December 18, 2023 * * * My dad was born a few hours out of Jerusalem. My mom was born in Utah, so both places where Jesus got resurrected… Now, my great-grandma was born in Bethlehem, and I t',\n",
       "  'ell people this. They’re like, “Oh, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?” I’m like, “Yeah, that’s the one.” She was Amish, she grew up in the holy land next to Scranton. She knew the three wise men from Dunder Mifflin. Come on! The birthplace of our savior, Bethlehem, PA? No, everybody knows Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, the savior of most people in this country. Yet, if you ask most people in this country to point it out on a map, they’re pointing to Pennsylvania. That’s a problem, but it’s not our fault. It’s a very difficult geopolitical question. I had to look it up just for this joke. Yeah, my niece asked me over Christmas. My niece is 5 years old. She said, “Where’s Jesus from?” I was like, “Bethlehem, nailed it right?” She was like, “Where’s Bethlehem?” I was like, “Oh, shit, here we go. I got to give her the simplest answer you can to a 5-year-old, but I also got to keep it real, you know.” So',\n",
       "  ', I was like, “Okay, um, well technically, Bethlehem is in Palestine, um, but America, we don’t recognize Palestine as a country, so technically it’s in the Palestinian territories, um, specifically the West Bank, not the Gaza Strip. It was part of Israel, but they handed it over to the Palestinian National Authority in 1995 under the term agreement of subpoint 5, section 2 of the UN resolution at the Oslo Accords. Thanks, Bill Clinton, uh, this was pre-Monica, never mind, uh, but, uh, of course, before that, it was British mandate Palestine, and before that, the Ottoman Empire, and before that, a conquest during the Crusades, and before that, another conquest, and before that, another conquest, before that, another conquest. Times back then, people were crazy, uh, before that, the Roman Empire, because it was the law, uh, before that, Judea, shout out to my Zionists, uh, before that, the Canaan',\n",

I made that up, uh, before that, random tribes from Africa, uh, black lives matter, and, uh, before that, it was the dinosaurs, if you believe in those. Believe, did they? Did they teach you those? They, and of course, before all of that, it was just lots and lots and lots of rocks, uh, which as we know, belong to the Palestinians. Um, now, one could argue that it still is in Israel technically because Israel technically occupies the West Bank, but of course, Israel would say that’s not the case because that’s illegal under international law, under many, many counts. Don’t tell the UN, JK, they already know. Oh my God, it’s a mess. Everybody knows, literally everybody knows, except most of the people in the country that could actually vote to stop it. God bless Pennsylvania. Merry Christmas. And that was the answer that I gave her in about 90 se',\n",
       "  'conds flat if you ever wanted to know where Bethlehem is, and I think she liked it ‘cuz she immediately responded with, “Is Santa Claus real?” I said, “100%, Santa Claus is real. We definitely recognize Santa Claus.” She’s like, “What are you getting me for Christmas?” I said, “I give you the gift of Palestine. What more do you want? Like, people usually pay to see my shows. I gave it to you free of charge.” She was like, “Free Palestine?” I was like, “Exactly!” I knew this was a safe space. As you can imagine, um, these jokes don’t do well all over the country. I did that bit not too long ago, and a guy comes up to me after and he’s like, “Hey buddy, let me give you some advice.” I’m like, “Oh, this is going to be good. This is why we do it. We come for the laugh, stay for the advice.” He’s like, “Let me give you some advice.” I’m like, “Lay it on me, buddy.” He’s like, “Don’t do political come',\n",
       "  'dy. It really divides the crowd.” I was like, “Wow, news flash. I’d never heard something more obvious in my life. Of course, political comedy divides the crowd. That’s what makes it fun. You say something divisive, press people’s buttons, split some hairs, and if you’re good enough, you can bring them back together with a really bad pun. That’s what makes comedy fun. If you think about it, everybody loves political comedy, just not at the same time! That’s how it works. You sit and you wait your turn till the comedian says something you like and stand for. You clap, you cheer, you go wild, and then for the rest, you politely shut your freedom hole. That’s democracy, baby.” And he’s like, “Well, if this is democracy, then I’m giving you my vote.” I’m like, “No, your vote is to laugh or not laugh. You’re trying to suppress other voters’ rights at this point is what you’re doing.” He’s like, “Budd',\n",
       "  'y, I’m just trying to give you some advice.” I said, “You’re giving me material, buddy, is what you’re doing.” And then, this was the best part, he leans in and he said, “Well, buddy, you should trust me ‘cuz I’m a magician.” I said, “What? Wait, what? What just happened? What did you just say? You just said, ‘Trust me I’m a magician.’ I don’t think anybody’s ever said that before in any language. This guy literally said ‘Trust me, I trick people for money.’ Trust me, I am a magician. I believe the saying is, ‘Don’t trust me, I deceive people on a regular basis.’ That is like, he might as well just pulled a dove out of his hat like, ‘Trust me, I’m a magician.’ Just comes out… ‘You’re a magician, and I’m dividing the crowd? Maybe stop sawing your audience members in half, you divisive mofo.’ Political comedy is fun because you divide the crowd, and then if you’re good enough, you can undivide the',\n",
       "  'm.” He’s like, “How do you undivide a crowd?” I’m like, “Trust me, I’m a math comic. Um, you split a crowd apart, and if you’re funny enough, you can bring them back together.” And he’s like, “Do you really believe that?” I was like, ♪ Do you believe in magic? ♪ ♪ Free Palestine ♪ And then the truth came out. He said, “Hey man, what made me upset is that I’m from Israel, and I don’t like you talking bad about my people.” I was like, “I wasn’t doing that. I was just, uh, telling a joke about historical accuracy. That– that was all I was doing.” And he says, “Yeah, but now when people meet me and I tell them I’m for Israel, they think I’m bad.” I’m like, “That’s not my fault. That’s between you and your government, buddy. Like, use your democracy over there.” And like, I get it.

Trying to get some pussy out here, you know what I’m saying? Trying to get laid in your country, not making me look good.” And I felt for this guy, but I just think, I think he ran out of words because he is a magician, and, uh, and then he just said, “Look man, I heard your Israel-Palestine jokes, and you’re just not building any bridges with those.” And I said, “I’m not trying to build bridges. I’m trying to get laughs, uh, that’s the point of comedy. I’m not like when I go to a show, I don’t hope that people throw little tiny toy bridges at the stage, you know.

       " ['Shane Gillis’ debut stand-up comedy special, recorded live at The Creek and The Cave in Austin, TX, offers a blend of edgy, controversial humor and personal anecdotes. Gillis touches on a variety of topics, from his own haircut mishaps to observations on family dynamics, politics, and societal issues. He jokes about his father’s Fox News obsession, racial dynamics in football, and the absurdity of modern social media culture. The special includes candid reflections on his family, like his sister’s struggles with addiction and recovery, and his own experience coaching in the Special Olympics. Gillis also delves into political satire, poking fun at both sides of the political spectrum, and provides irreverent takes on pop culture and current events. His approach mixes dark humor with a candid examination of the absurdities of everyday life. * * * All right, I was thinking about the first time Congress had to come up with an age of consent. Imagine those in powdered wigs, that had to be a rough day for the fellas. It’s like some guy coming up first, like from Rhode Island, “12!” And everyone’s like, “Ew, ew, no dude. I don’t know why I have to go first on this one. It’s like the hardest one to go first on.” [Laughter] This is exciting. I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane f*ckup. My hair was fine, totally fine, and then two days ago, I was like, “I gotta salvage this.” It’s crazy that I thought the hair was the issue, like fixing my hair would make me look good. That was the final piece of the puzzle for me. There’s a Dominican barber shop by my house in New York. I think I’m the first white guy that’s ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barber shop. And they f*cked me up, dude. Don’t get a Dominican haircut if you’re white; you end up just looking more racist. It was nice though, he kept trying to reassure me the whole time, “No, man, your head’s good.” I was like, “Oh, thank you, whatever this haircut is. How are you guys?” [Applause] It’s good, it’s good. I’m happy, it’s nice, everybody’s back inside and all that shit. I don’t know, I had a good time. I live in New York, so I left. I went back to my parents’ house because I have white privilege. Some people didn’t get to leave the city, I did, because of my privilege. And I used it. You gotta use it! You know what I mean? Does it feel more disrespectful to waste it? You know what, then we’re all just being racist for nothing. But no, it’s good. I went home. My parents, I haven’t lived with them in over 10 years. They got old. They’re old as f*ck. I’m back on milk. Been f*cking crushing milk lately. I got f*cking milk fat this year. It’s a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. I’m 33. It was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was watching my dad watch the news. It’s a rough year for my dad and the news. He’s a Fox News guy. Don’t do that. It’s fine. Also, I see you guys, most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers? That’s a good dad. I don’t watch Fox, but that’s a good Fox News mom. That’s fat. You don’t want Fox News mom, that’s a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that’s a good f*cking dad. Can you imagine if you had a f*cking MSNBC dad? There’s some guy every night at dinner like, “We need to start focusing on renewable energy.” It’s like, “Ew, dude, I didn’t know dad was gay, talking to me about solar panels like a f*cking lady.” He might have her straight as hell, dude. We f*cking hate the environment. Tha',\n",
       "  \"t’s how straight we are. All we talk about is eating pussy and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don’t even eat fish. We just catch them and f*ck… He’s good, he likes Fox. He watches it every night like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can’t. That’s how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad will watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere, he’ll just stand up and be like, “F*cking Mr. Potato Head’s trans, I’m going to bed. This world’s going to hell.” He’s all about it, dude. He loves it. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He’s just trying to get one fact. That’s all he’s doing. He’s sitting there, trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever’s unlucky enough to enter the living room while he’s watching. And you’d think it’d be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while, there’s like a commercial for like a commemorative 9/11 gold coin, just f*cking wipes their hard drive. “What was I watching? I gotta get one of those. I got my hands on those patriotic coins.” [Laughter] My dad drinks too, so he can never get a fact, ever. He’ll come in the living room, we’ll be, he’s hammered, watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like, just hammered on a a recliner, like, “Whoa.” It’s like footage of rocket attacks in Israel, he’s like, “Whoa, what the hell are they doing over there? What’s this guy’s problem?” But he can never get a fact. Like, he tries. He uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he’s trying to say. Like, everyone, like, we’ll be eating dinner and like Hannity will be saying something, he’s like, “See that? That’s what I meant. Look at that. That’s me talking. I can’t say it that good.” He can never get a fact. You’ll walk in the living room, he’s been watching the news for three hours, he’ll be like, “Alright, what’s going on in the world?” He’s like, “Do you want to know? I’ll tell you. F*cking Nancy Pelosi is a bitch… All right, settle down, dude.” That was the news last, that’s the news every night from my dad. They’re just like, “Breaking, did you know Nancy Pelosi is a bitch?” I had a feeling. But he likes everything they say. He agrees with it. He’s all in. I realize, like, Fox News is basically Black Church for old white dudes. You know what I mean? Like, literally, everything they say, my dad just, “Say it, like, ‘Yes, preach, Tucker!'” Every once in a while, he gets hit with the Holy Spirit while he’s watching it. The Holy Ghost visits him, he’s just like, “Oh, Lord, build a wall! Can I get a wall?” He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in central Pennsylvania, securing the southern border is oddly important to him. I don’t know what he’s worried about, like he’s going to lose his job. You know, like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania, just slam a resume down on my dad’s boss’s desk: “You’re here for the sales position? Stay quiet, also.” I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There’s a wall. I had no idea. I got down there, saw the wall, and I was like, “Holy shit, he built it.” They were like, “No, it’s been here, it’s been here for like a century.” You got to tell my dad. It’ll f*ck him up. He gets fired up every night. It’s a crazy way to go to bed every night, just… So, there’s apnea mask on every night. You walk in the living room in my house right now, my dad, he’d hit you like, “Southern borde\",\n",
       "  'r’s a mess, right?” It’s crazy. But I make fun of him for it, and then I do the exact same thing, just with my phone. Every night, I just look at my phone until I can’t. I’m like, “Mr. Potato Head’s trans, that’s it.” Every day, I just get on, read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like, in person, I know they’re dumb. I’ve talked to them. I’m still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It’s great. And my Twitter is crazy. It’s half where I’m from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania, so it’s white trash. And then half, now I live in New York, so it’s crazy, they all got Twitter, they all get f*cking fired up, they have like zero followers and just tweet into the void… They love it, they do it for the love of the game. And now all my new friends, they’re literally communists from Brooklyn. So it’s wild, dude. My social, like, I’ll get on Twitter, and the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that’s just like, “F*cking Colin Kaepernick better stand up. Like this tweet if you support the police, share it if you’re not gay.” “I’m like, f*ck it, I’m sharing that.”And then the next post is just one of my new woke white friends that’s just like, “I’m not racist.” That’s it. Every day, for the last year, just a different white person popping up, like, “Look at me, look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I’m not racist, right?” It’s like, “Alright, are you sure?” I don’t know if you know this, like being racist isn’t like a yes or no thing. You know what I mean? It’s not like you have it or you don’t have it. Being racist is more, it’s like being hungry. You know, it’s like, “Yeah, you’re not hungry right now. But a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway, you get hungry.” We’re hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No, okay. Cheeseburgers, whatever, whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was in your racist heart. Anyway. That’s it. I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news, is kind of like, “This is the most divided this country has ever been,” say with the, like, the red states and the blue states. It’s like, “Why? Because we tweet at each other?” You know, we had a war, right? You know, this country had a Civil War. That was pretty divided. Like, at least nowadays, we’re communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never… They got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse, and they were like, “Who’s talking shit?” The guy was like, “The South is talking shit.” “F*ck that, I don’t like that. Give me my gun. I’m gonna go down there. I’m gonna walk down there for a month straight, shoot the first f*cking guy I see down there.” The Civil War was basically just the North just shooting racism out of the South. That’s what happened. The North was like, “South, f*cking chill.” And the South was like, “No.” So a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot them a lot. And they’re like, “Alright, we’ll let them go, but we are not gonna be nice to them for a while until we find out they’re good at football and then, Roll Tide.” [Laughter] Yeah, “Roll Damn Tide.” I don’t like Alabama football. I watched this documentary on Alabama football. It’s great. It’s about… Well, it’s not… I don’t know if you should say it’s great. But it’s about Alabama football. It’s about when they desegregated their football team. So, up until this point, Alabama football was just white, alright? And everybody down there was pumped about that. They would pack the stadium, everyone would be lik',\n",
       "  'e, “Look at all those whites running around, catching it.” Hey, look, I’m not knocking them too hard because I still have a little bit of that in me. You know, like if a white guy catches the ball on Sunday, I’m like, “Oh shit, go, go, go, go, go! Ah, they got him. They got him. It’s a tough run, a smart run, heads up run there.” But no, they took it too far. And uh, so the documentary focuses on that. It focuses on Bear Bryant. Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They’re like, “F*cking way to go, Bear. You did it. What a hero.” And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, well, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit, 71? Like, we had been to the moon. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. [Laughter] Does anyone understand? There were white corners. White cornerbacks. You understand how preposterous that is? Some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They’re extinct. They don’t exist. There are two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won’t reproduce. You’ll never see a white corner. But that’s what happened. It wasn’t like… The reason they desegregated the team it was — that’s what the documentary focuses on, which is great — because it wasn’t like\\xa0 “Oh hey, fellas. It’s 1971. Maybe we should get with the times.” What happened was Alabama scheduled USC, Southern Cal. Alabama was confident. They’re like, “Oh, white boys will take on anybody and then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from L.A. and just beat the f*ck out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech, and he was like, “Hey, y’all, come on.” That was it. That’s all it took. Everybody down there was like, “Yeah, we get it. We’ll be less racist if it means we can win.” What? That’s what it is. Like, as big as racism is in America, football, that’s true. That’s true. Look, the GOAT. There’s a Disney movie, Remember the Titans, dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that movie was one high school football season. Remember the Titans was like, eight weeks. You know, that whole town went from like centuries of like, “Don’t let them in our school,” to just like, “Oh shit, the high school team’s 4-0. Those are my brothers.” [Laughter] All right, I’ll get off the topic. The point I’m trying to make, the point I’m trying to make is, if you want to get rights in America, you just gotta put together a good football team. You know what I mean? Like, if the transgenders got together and put together just a f*cking hard-nose, run-it-down-your-throat ball club, the trans, just three yards and a cloud of dust of transgenders, if the trans community could just somehow upset Alabama, everybody down there tomorrow would be like, “Those are some tough bitches… actually, right.” [Applause] All right, we got out of that. There are some rough patches in there. That’s all right. Well, this won’t go great either. [Laughter] You know how like every show and movie now, it’s like a remake of something? They just remake an old thing and just make it more progressive and just put it out. Like, they remade Ocean’s 11, like a heist movie, with all gorgeous women. That movie should have been 10 minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. They’d be like, “Here are the keys to the safe. Take everything. I love you. You guys, you crazy b',\n",
       "  \"itches. I love you bitches.” It’s just… That’s all they make. They either make that or they make slavery movies every year. Those are for no one. I have black friends. I was like, “Dude, you guys like these?” They’re like, “No, we thought these were for you.” Like, “No, we all hate those.” Stop making them. It’s uncomfortable. Civil Rights movies are good, though. I like, like Judas and the Black Messiah was sick. Remember the Titans is great. Hidden Figures was the movie about the black ladies at NASA, or as my dad likes to call it, “Medea Goes to the Moon.” Look, that was him that said that. He said that. As soon as he said it, I was like, “What did you f*cking say? You don’t talk like that.” So every movie is just remade, more progressive. I just think it’d be funny if, like, the right started remaking, you know what I mean? If they just start, like, conservatives, like, there’s a new Scooby-Doo coming out. And it’d be funny if, like, the right remade it. It’s just like Scooby and the gang going around ripping the wigs off of transgender people. It’s like, “That’s not a woman!” Some guy, “I would have got away with it.” “We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul.” [Laughter] Has enough time passed that we can admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that? He was funny. Well, hold on, I don’t like the tone on that, that’s not what I’m going for here. “Yeah, the great leader…” He was funny. Now, whether or not that’s a great quality for the Commander-in-Chief, that’s definitely up for debate. But he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office, I would be like, you know, something would happen, I’d show my friends, like, “Look at that.” They’d be like, “What? It’s funny, okay? There’s nothing funny about Donald Trump.” I don’t… I don’t know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, “Maybe we should nuke it.” Like, that was a real suggestion from the president. The president of the United States. He was like, “Hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up?” And I was like, “No, what the f*ck are you talking about?” “I don’t know, I just f*ck around dude. That’s what I do.” I don’t know. Now that he’s gone, I’ll never watch a debate ever again. Can you imagine, like, just a regular debate now, after we went like… We witnessed the GOAT, undefeated in debates, and he never said a fact. You know how impressive that is? He was funny, and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People tried to hit him with statistics and facts, he would just go, “Wrong.” Holy f*ck, dude. How is no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how good, how electric that shit was. Don’t tell your friends in Austin, they’ll be mad. Just get a six-pack, toss on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It’s a good night, dude. Why, I went back. I watched his first debate. That’s like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was pulling at like less than one percent. Like, he was nobody. If you guys like him now, you didn’t back then. And I know that because my dad, my dad at the time, any time Trump even came on TV, my dad was like, “Get this f*cking joker off the screen.” And then now, my dad’s like, “Guys can’t go to the Capitol? He’s like, ‘Guys can’t have fun anymore?'” It was because of the debates. That’s what did it, dude. That’s how we got Trump, these debates. And the first one is the best one. So it’s a Republican primary, everyone’s up on stage, and they’re all still doing their political shit So like the first couple \",\n",
       "  \"of guys that talk are like, “I’m from Kentucky, and I love education.” And the crowd’s like, “Nice, we didn’t know what was coming.” Then the next guy’s like, “I’m from Georgia, and I love religion.” The crowd’s like, “Pretty good, this is a good one.” It was a heated debate. And then it finally got to Trump’s turn to talk, and he was just like, “Rand Paul is ugly.” And the whole crowd was like, “Oh, we didn’t know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing?” And Rand Paul was like, “Alright everybody, settle down. We’re trying to have a debate here.” And the whole crowd was like, “Shut the f*ck up, Rand Paul. Ugly bitch!” And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make him debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives, and they just had to debate a f*cking maniac up there who didn’t give a f*ck. And I hated him, but it was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates because, dude, he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years, and then he showed up to the event like, “Oh f*ck, what are we talking about?” He had no clue. Every week, he had no f*cking idea. There’s one debate, there’s one debate, he’s like in the middle of it, going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They’re literally talking about the economy, and in the middle of it, he’s just like, “Ted’s wife is ugly as a dog.” Holy shit, dude. Ted was like, “I’m from Texas, you don’t talk about a man’s family like that.” And Trump’s like, “You’ve got a dog wife, Ted. Everyone knows.” Yeah, and a week later, Ted Cruz was on TV like, “I support Donald J…” He’s like, “You pussy” I will say this, the one thing that sucked about Trump losing was, for me, it was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That’s kind of a bummer. It’s not hard to do Trump. It’s very… all you have to do, do that, do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence, and then all you… like, you don’t have to sound like him, all you have to do is get his cadence down. It’s very easy. All you have to do is describe something and then say you described it that way. That’s it. It’s every time, like, “What a big room this is. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, what a big room.'” [Applause] “Austin, a lot of homeless. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of homeless’.” You guys got it. You got a lot of homeless. What are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working. So cheap. Switch, I don’t know what to do either, but do something. “A lot of tents.” [Laughter] “Why?” It’s been making me laugh, thinking about Trump, like not understanding why people are homeless. “I walked out, I saw them, I said, ‘Why are you living in tents?’ I could never. These guys…” But I will say this about Trump, I don’t want you guys to get… I don’t want to turn this into a rally. I will say this, so don’t freak out, just listen. I will… I think it’s fair to say that of all the presidents we’ve had, I think it’s fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know, dude, the patriots got fired up on that. Dude, I was having fun at this show. No, look, I didn’t even say it would be funny. I said funniest. It’s a huge difference. Technically, there’s the funniest of everything. There is. It doesn’t make it funny, but there is, like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There’s a funniest one. I’ll go first. I’ll think of one. Sc\",\n",
       "  \"hool shooting. None of those are funny. Zero funny. But maybe there was one where, like, the horse girl in the class, like, could sense something was coming. You know what I mean? They’re like, “What’s wrong?” And she was like… [Laughter] But back to what I was saying about, if you had… What I said was true. If you had to rank them, from least funny to funniest assassination, easy, number one. Really. He’d be talking shit, like, when it happened, he’d be doing like a rally, “My opponent’s gay. I walked in, I saw him, I said, ‘Wow, this guy’s gay.’ ” The shooter would be coming out, “Sit down. You’re gay.” Get hit. He’d definitely make a funny noise into the… Like, he’d get hit, fall funny. I will say, I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don’t think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden’s the first president you could punch assassinate. You know what I mean? Just walk right up through the metal, “Texas, Mr. President, the hell are you doing, dude?” It’s a body shot. [Laughter] I’d add that joke… My dad’s… “He can’t be talking about killing presidents.” What about body… Music. My dad’s… He’s a good guy. He’s an alcoholic, but he’s good. He’s like a good alcoholic. He’s not hurting anybody. But everyone’s, he’s always got an excuse for why he’s drinking. That’s what’s funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered and be like, “Yeah, I got f*cked up.” It’s always like, “You’ll see him on like a Monday, you’ll be like, ‘Damn, it’s Monday, you’re getting f*cked up?’ He’s like, ‘It’s Monday Night Football. Have a couple of drinks, geez.'” You’ll see him on like a Tuesday, you’ll be like, “Damn, it’s Tuesday, you’re getting f*cked up?” He’s like, “It’s Tuesday. There’s no football.” [Music] What the hell. And my sister does heroin, and uh, and that one, we’re like, “You do need to stop doing that.” Which sucks for her because if she played guitar, everybody would be like, “She’s a genius.” Instead, she’s a hairdresser, so it’s not as cool. Relax, it’s my family. It’s my family. Don’t worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I’m sure it’s actually a lot of your guys’ families too. And that’s all right. We’re allowed to talk about it. My sister, since she was doing heroin, we had to have an intervention for her. She lived out in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania. So we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick them. I don’t know if you know these guys, they’re not just f*cking stopping by. They’re very busy. They’re the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy because they take a lot of naps. But if they’re awake, they’re f*cking…very busy. They’re scurrying around, dude, doing quests. That’s what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money. You got to start doing quests. You know, it’s… You know, it’s like a f*cked up game of Zelda every day. You just wake up to a new quest. It’s like, “You need to gather coppers. Gonna find a scrap yard.” It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually, the quests get pretty dark. Scrapyard, that’s like level one. Towards the end, the quest, you need to get titty behind the Home Depot. [Laughter] It’s when it’s time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to Six Flags. And it worked. She called back, she’s already, “Alright, I’ll be there.” Just got on the first bus. It’s like \",\n",
       "  \"a seven-hour bus ride. There’s nothing to them, dude. No, if you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. It’s a five-minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was, pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to Six Flags. They could take her to a hotel, where we’re gonna have an intervention. I didn’t want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust, so I took her to Six Flags the day of her intervention. The morning of that day, she and I went to Six Flags together. And I thought that was a nice gesture, but it turns out an intervention is supposed to be rock bottom. You know what I mean? Like, an intervention’s supposed to be the worst day of your life, not like you’re tired from easily the best day humanly possible. I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was… Dude, it was impossible. We sat down with her, like, “You better\\xa0 f*cking change your life.” She’s like, “I’m going back tomorrow.” And I was with her. She was… She was f*cked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest Hines Ward for the occasion. [Laughter] So we get in there, there’s a water park there. We didn’t know they added that. We haven’t been there since we were kids. We get in there, there’s one of those water slides, it’s just like a f*cking straight drop. No sides on it, no raft, just by yourself. She looks at it, she’s like, “I wanna go up on that one.” I was like, “Yeah, alright, yeah, f*ck it… you know, I knew she was going to rehab like that night, so I was like, ‘Yeah, get this one in. You’re gonna have a rough couple of months here.'” Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants, trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her f*cking crocs off. Her yellow crocs. So she’s climbing up this ladder, she gets to the top of this f*cking giant water slide. You like when it’s your turn next on a water ride, you got to lay there in that water and wait to go? She nodded off. She took a nap, up at the top, like a Dracula, laying in front of some high school lifeguard that’s like, “Uh, ma’am, it’s your turn.” He just sent her down, asleep, just flying down this thing, dude. There’s a ramp at the end. She hit it, and we all got to watch her wake up in mid-air. She did the whole f*cking… I don’t know how that wasn’t f*cking rock bottom. So, you woke up in mid-air. Anyway, don’t be sad about it. She’s good. She did go to rehab, and that’s good. Yeah, she’s done. She stopped using. She’s sober. She’s all good. Two years clean. [Applause] Yeah, yeah, it’s good. She did… Uh, she did get cancer, though. So… And COVID. Cancer and COVID. So, I’ll tell you what, this was cool. I got… I was with her. I was with her. She was at home. She went back to my parents’ house because when you have cancer and COVID, you got to go home. You can’t keep hanging out. But no, I was with her. It was crazy. She… This year, she beat heroin, cancer, and COVID. It was like living with Rocky. It was crazy, dude. Every week, my whole family was like, “Give up. You’re never gonna win this.” She’s like… Just kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, “Alright, you’re definitely dead.” “I ain’t hear no bell.” Just wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she’s got a hell of a chin. A hell of a chin on my sister. And what better quality could you ask for in a human? Anyway… Damn, dudes. F*ck that music across the street, dude, that f*cking bothers me\",\n",
       "  '. I’m an old man now. “Turn it down. Okay, now what is that? Rap? Turn it off. Gotta talk about my sister doing heroin over here!” This has been making me laugh. I’ve been thinking about like the first time, uh… Like, uh, Jesus Christ. I do comedy a lot, and every once in a while, you can hear music from another room. And it’s like, “Damn, dude, music’s so much better.” Every time I hear music, I’m like, “F*ck dude, that crushes what I do.” Some idiot dressed like Cam Newton pressing play. It’s so much better than this. You guys want to hear about my problems? This guy’s like, “Take Molly, finger someone. I’m gonna press play. You guys do you.” F*ck they’re having so much fun over there. Get the f*ck out of here, go dance. I knew you wanted to dance. That guy wanted to dance all night. Alright, I like my family. It’s a good family. I had to go to my niece’s 7th and 8th grade girls’ volleyball match recently. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding, dude. Shut up. Just relax. I don’t want to f*ck kids, but if you ever want to get out of something, that’s all you have to do. Like, if your friend’s like, “Do you want to come to our son’s T-ball game?” Be like, “What grade are the kids in?” And then, no matter what they say, go, “Fourth?” [Laughter] No, I went to this f*cking kids’ volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It’s weird. It’s gross, dude. Just get them gym shorts. That’s all. No, dude, it’s gross because then, you know, it’s just me and the other uncles up in the… up in the bleachers, kind of making eye contact with each other like, “Bro, are you seeing this?” [Laughter] Such a funny way to just destroy a show, just right at the very end, be like, “Aren’t kids hot? Yo, give it up for Trump. Aren’t kids hot?” No, I am. I truly am serious about the gym shorts, though. It’s weird. And so I got home from this f*cking volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball. So I’m very excited to, like, shit on volleyball whenever I can. So I get in there, and I was like, “Yo, volleyball is f*cking…, that’s a weird culture. Get them f*cking shorts. Get them gym shorts. The shorts they’re wearing is gross.” And she was like, “No, we need those shorts for speed on the court.” And I was like, “Uh, I know that’s not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref, and those guys are wearing like slacks, dress shoes, for some reason.” She was like, “No, we need those shorts. The tight shorts, they’re essential.” She compared them to like a helmet in football. I was like, “I know they’re not essential because I Googled the Special Olympics volleyball team.” [Laughter] All of a sudden, those shorts weren’t so essential for them. What’s that about? How baggy do you think they’re… They look like the f*cking AND1 Mixtape out there. Offensively baggy is how I would describe all of their attires. [Laughter] We’re all adults. We can… This, we all agree the Special Olympics is a good… It’s a good program. I just… It’s great. I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk-taker. You know what I mean? That’s a wild thing to suggest for the first time. Some guy in a board meeting like, “I got an idea. We should be racing these motherf*ckers.” Like, “What’d you say?” “Uh, town over said that they’re the fastest ones. Say we settle it, you know?” I’m not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It’s a wild, like, if your best friend invented the Special Olympics and told you about it first, you’d be l',\n",
       "  'ike, “Don’t ever tell anybody that. Who the f*ck are you going to tell that to? What are you doing? Pole vault?” [Laughter] I actually, personally, I actually volunteered and coached with the Special Olympics for a little while. So, you know what? You guys do… No, don’t clap, please. I did it for those kids. [Applause] I look like this, so me coaching the Special Olympics, I was like a f*cking double agent. No one knew whose side I was on, dude. Player, chaperone, no one knew. I’d be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard, with five dudes that looked exactly like me. I always see the coaches from the other team looking over like, “I think they got… I think they’re f*cking letting one of them coach.” Yeah, no, I did coach the Special Olympics for a little while. And it’s fun. That’s another thing, you’re allowed to talk about it. It’s happy, everyone there’s sportsmanship. It is funny. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It’s fun. I coached basketball. Kids would catch the ball, just launch it into the bleachers. People be like “What the f*ck are you doing out there?” My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team, they were the funniest. They were bros. They’re bros, dude. My whole team loved two things: they love tits, they do. I don’t know if you know these guys, dude. They f*cking love the ladies. And they love John Cena. That’s it. That was the news every day. We’d be in the huddle, they’d be like, “A lot of ladies here tonight.” I was like, “Yeah.” They’d be like, “What do you think John Cena is up to?” “Oh, you’re gonna have to get way worse before you meet him.” See, he’s just like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys, I was like, “You see Cena coming, you get the f*ck out of there. He’s taking souls with him.” [Laughter] Every year, Hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. Alright? So, every year, Hooters would bring like three or four waitresses, and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just like dudes got competitive. Like very competitive. F*cking ripping down rebounds, just hitting layups. [Laughter] And then at the end of the game, there’d be a hug line, you know, between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly how you would imagine that went. We had to break out the f*cking jaws of life, dude. My boys, my boys were ragging on those young sluts. And I’m not knocking the players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses, like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself. Alright, I think I’m going to get out of here, guys. Thank you guys very much. This was a lot of fun. Thank you. [Applause] [Music] * * * \\n Your email address will not be published.

He starts by humorously recounting his weight fluctuation during the pandemic, blending self-deprecation with sharp social commentary. Halkias then navigates through topics like the generational differences between millennials and baby boomers, the absurdities of everyday life, and the complexities of relationships and sexuality. His storytelling is both vivid and relatable, as he candidly shares tales of his struggles with sobriety, his adventures in dating, and his experiences as the son of immigrant parents. Halkias’ delivery is unapologetically honest and often outrageous, serving up a mix of poignant reflections and laugh-out-loud moments that explore the human condition with a blend of empathy and irreverence.

Please put your hands together for Stavros Halkias! Alright. Hell yeah. Alright. L.A. How we doing, gang? Huh? F*ck yes. Oh. Thank you for coming out. F*ck with your boy. How do I look, huh? Stop. Stop. Come on. You know, you know I had to come out here looking like a f*cking sidequest boss on GTA. I’ll have you motherf*ckers selling pornography all across San Andreas. Yeah. I’m happy to be out, man. I really am. It’s nice to be out and about. This is cool, being in a packed show again, you know? Sucked being indoors for, like a whole year, you know? Although, I have to admit, I had a pretty productive pandemic. I’m not gonna lie. I lost 50 pounds during the pandemic. Ehh? Thank you. Yeah. That was, that was during the second half of the pandemic. During the first half, I gained 45 pounds. So I kind of took the scenic route to losing five pounds. Yeah, dude. I was f*cked as soon as it happened. There was no chance. There was no chance I wasn’t gonna get fat as hell. You know what I mean? Yeah, because it was a scary time, right? We’re all, you know, we’re cooped up, we’re anxious, we don’t know what’s gonna happen. And I’m a very emotional eater, you know? Like I use food as drugs. But I also use drugs as drugs. You know what I mean? Like you shouldn’t be able to eat a whole pizza on cocaine, but. I’m five for five, you know what I mean? I power through every time. Yeah. Remember the first part of the pandemic where it was all Tiger King and online shopping? Remember? Where it was like, I swear to God, If this f*cks up Cinco de Mayo, I’m gonna be pissed. Remember that? I got fat as hell during that part. And I was f*cked up the whole time. I was just taking edibles like they were birth control, you know? Like an alarm would go off on my phone. I’d be like, Whoa! Time for 90 milligrams. Jeez, I almost had a thought today. That, that was a close one. I almost reflected today. It didn’t help that they made you feel like a hero for ordering takeout, by the way. Remember that? Every commercial’s like, Support your local restaurants. We need you right now. It’s like, Oh my God. Well, if called upon, I will serve. Hello? Yes. More lo mein. FAST. Hurry. We have to combat the xenophobia the Chinese are up against right now. More dumplings. I have to stop Asian hate. I have to stop Asian hate by almost stopping my own heart. That’s how it’s gonna happen. Yeah, I thought I was gonna die for a year in a row. Because I felt like sh*t. I would check the symptoms and I don’t know if you realized this, but the symptoms are just being fat. That’s it. That’s what they describe dude, right? Like every symptom’s like, have you ever had shortness of breath? Aches and pains? Or diarrhea? It’s like, every day since I’m nine years old. What do you mean? I had COVID in third grade, is that what you’re saying? Even loss of taste. Yeah, I’ve burned my mouth on a Hot Pocket before. Yeah, everyone young— I’m 32. I feel like me, everyone me and under. We’re f*cked. You know, it’s, millennials and under, we’re f*cked, right? We’re the first generation that’s gonna do worse than our parents statistically. You know what I mean? Which sucks. But the worst part is that our parents think it was because they were so smart. You know what I mean? That, I can’t stand that. I’m tired of hearing it from baby boomers. Right? Like their lives were so easy. You could just win a house at a carnival back then. You know what I mean? Just some guy, like. Oh. Nice. A three-bedroom. Awesome. Honey, we’re moving again. Yeah, have you ever ',\n",
       "  'tried to get advice from them about a job? They’re like, Well, did you look him in the eye and shake his hand? And it’s like, Yeah. I did that. Like, Huh? Well, that’s how I became the vice president of Circuit City. So I’m— I’m out of ideas. They all think we’re children too. These millenials spending all their money on lollipops. It’s like, okay, I need a CPAP machine, actually, but. And these lollipops have weed in them, by the way. So a little more expensive than you might think. Yeah. Sucks. They ruined the world. Global warming. That’s them, right? Not for anything good either. I think it was mostly hairspray, right? That’s it. Like every Bon Jovi concert took a centimeter off the polar ice caps, I’m pretty sure. Like, Oh, now I have to f*cking wash my yogurt cups. Why? Why? You wanted a Jheri curl so I have to rinse out garbage now? How is that fair? They ruined drunk driving. That was them, right? Come on. You know how fun that would be right now? Know what I’m saying? F*cking, get on one of those electric scooters four Truly’s deep. That would be sick. But no, somebody couldn’t handle their Quaaludes, so. But the good news is sh*t is only gonna continue to get worse. So we’re going to be able to do that to our kids. Right? I can’t wait to flex on my children. Right? Just talking to my adult son like, Hey, buddy, come on, you’re 30 years old. You can’t be splitting a tent with six people anymore. Alright? When I was your age, I only had one roommate, and I owned my Nintendo switch. So you got, you got a lot of growing up to do, pal. Okay? Go get a job selling your plasma just like everybody else. Oh, I need to be patient with you? You tell me about patience when you’ve jacked off to a dial-up internet connection, okay? When you’ve accidentally busted to a forehead that was still loading. Then we can talk about patience. When you have printed out a picture of WWE superstar Trish Stratus on an inkjet printer to jack-off to later. Then we can talk about patience. Now quiet down. The Boston Dynamics robot might hear us. Yeah. There’s no like part of the bit where I’m like, But you know what? If we all stick together, we— No I think we’re f*cked. Unless somebody, you know, shmassassinates Shmeffrey Shmezos. I didn’t say it. Legally, I didn’t say anything. You can’t get me legally. Yeah, we’re f*cked. Like that guy gets to just go to the moon and this guy will never see a doctor in his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. But hey, whatever. Just get us sucked off as possible. That’s what I think. Yeah. Focus on yourself, you know? Have some goals. Improve yourself. Have a good time. I got goals. I got stuff I want to improve. Right? I want to keep losing weight. You know, that’s one of my goals. For a lot of reasons. though, you know? Number one, I’m tired of being fetishized. You know, that’s. Not sexually but platonically. You know? ‘Cause people look at me and they think, Oh, Oh, there’s a big fat party animal. Right? But that’s a lot of pressure, you guys. You know what my Hawaiian shirt budget is? It’s crazy. You think I only want to do cannonballs? No. I want to do other dives, you guys. But everybody expects a certain thing from me, it hurts my feelings. I had a real fat boy pet peeve happen to me the other day. I dropped a slice of pizza on the ground and enough people saw me that I had to throw it away. That— Oof. That was tough. Oh, boy. Just gonna take this to the trash. Of course. That’s where I was going. That’s where I’d be going if you weren’t here. That’s for sure. Definitely wouldn’t be eating this with 10% less enthusiasm. Yeah. I had another moment happen where it was, like, really showed me I need to get back in the gym a little bit, you know? Like I was taking the steps on the subway and I fell down the steps, and none of the Black teens around me made fun of me. They were all just concerned for my well-being. Do you know how much that stings? To be too fat for the scorn of Black teens? It’s like, No, come on, man, don’t call me sir. Take your phone out. Record me! Make me feel alive. They wouldn’t do it, dude. They were just good Samaritans, it broke my heart. Yeah. I don’t know. It’s not just weight loss, though. I got other sh*t I wanna work on. I want to grow— I’m 32. I feel like I should grow up a little bit, you know? Like, I feel like this is the year. No more floor pills, right? No more finding loose pharmaceuticals on the ground, and trying to get f*cked up off what turns out to be heartburn medicine. Like that’s over for me. I am trying to stay sober, though. That’s real. I’m trying to stay sober. It’s been about four ',\n",
       "  'weeks, you know? Four weeks since— Alright. Thank you. Yeah. It’s alright, I’ll be back. Don’t worry. After this show, I’ll be back. If I’m being honest with you guys. Yeah, I just had to cool my jets for a sec. It’s hard, man. I— My problem with sobriety is I keep doing drugs, you know? Because drugs rock, right? Here’s how good drugs are. You know what my favorite movie of all time is? It’s this nature documentary about tropical fish that I watched on mushrooms at my friend’s place. And the colors were so vibrant and the story was so gripping. Halfway through, I’m like, Dude, what is this? I got to look this up. And he looks at me and goes, You are watching a screensaver right now. It’s like, Hm. Okay. Well, don’t touch the mouse, please. I’m rather invested in this right now. I’d like to see how this ends. Thank you. I’m trying to stay sober. I’m trying to watch less porn, trying to be off porn. One of my friends, he was off porn, too. I was like, Sick, dude, what’s your secret? Let’s compare notes. And he was like, Oh, I’ve just been having sex with a lot of women. It’s like, Okay, man, that’s not being off porn, right? You can’t be like, No more video games for me. No more Madden. I’m just on the Dallas Cowboys now. No more Call of Duty. I bought a gun, so. Take this for a spin. Yeah. I keep trying to improve year by year. You know, I was real depressed a few years ago when I first moved to New York. Things were tough, you know? And I was venting to a friend, and they tried to cheer me up. They’re like, Dude, you shouldn’t be depressed. If child-you could see what your life is like, he’d be thrilled. It’s like, really? That’s the metric we want to use? That a child wants my life? It’s like, yeah, he does, but for the wrong reasons, right? He’s like, Hey, what’s life like? Will there be ice cream? There’ll be ice cream every day. Sometimes for breakfast. For breakfast? Won’t that taste weird when you brush your teeth? You’re not— You’re not doing that that much anymore. Oh, really? Will there be sleepovers? Will I see my friends? You’re gonna live with four of your friends. Every day is a sleepover that you can’t escape. Oh, that rules. I hope no girls come and ruin it. I would not worry about that one right now. That last one is not gonna be an issue, unfortunately. No, that’s an old joke. I f*ck, of course, but. Things were tough. I’m not going to lie to you. Yeah. When I first moved to New York, I didn’t have my own room. I had the corner of a large living room, and I’m glad I’m out of there. But there is something I miss about that. There’s a certain level of camaraderie that comes with that kind of poverty. You know? Like, I miss clowning your boy when you heard him bust too fast. You know what I mean? Because there was five of us in a three-bedroom. Everybody knew the exact tempo everybody else f*cked at in that apartment. There was nothing funnier than hearing that IKEA bed frame stop squeaking just a little too fast. You know? Letting out an audible laugh that cut through your paper-thin walls. Pretty soon, everybody’s joining in. Ha ha ha ha. It was nice. Yeah. I’m doing better now, though. You know? Things are pretty good. I grew up pretty poor. I was poor until pretty recently. And I’m not poor anymore. But I’m not rich either. What I am is the richest a poor person could ever imagine becoming. You know what I mean? Like, I’m get appetizers every time rich, you know? Like, it’s not just for birthdays anymore. I’m dipping sauce rich, a lot, a lot of my money is tied up in ranch right now. I’m big ass TV, No health insurance rich, right? I got Xbox and PlayStation, but no Blue Cross/Blue Shield. That’s. Yeah, I don’t know. I did do one smart thing. I did do one kind of like investment thing. I bought a house. That’s something, right, guys? Thank you. It’s in the sh*tty neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in southeast Baltimore. Greektown. I grew up in season two of The Wire to tell you, basically. Pretty easy to get a house there. I’m not gonna lie to you. To give you an idea, when we moved in, one of our neighbors warned us that the other neighbor was gay. So. You get a little idea of what the property values are like over there. Right? And the way he did it was hilarious, too, because he was like, Listen. Good guy and everything, but watch out. For what? What am I watching out for? What is this man? Some kind of gay raccoon? You know what I mean? Like, Hey, buddy. You’re gonna want to lock your dicks up overnight, okay? Cover ’em, chain ’em up, bring ’em indoors. This man’s got a real nose for a penis. Alright? He will get to a cock',\n",
       "  ', I promise you that. Got me a couple times. Stay safe out there. Yeah, we got the best white trash in Baltimore, dude. Extra strength white trash. They got their own little dialect. You know? If you were talking to a guy that I grew up around, here’s how the conversation would go. It would be the dumbest thing you’ve ever heard, sounding horrible, but with the most confidence, right? It’s always some guy that’s like, Yo. You know what I don’t understand about traffic? Why don’t the guy in the front just go. Just f*cking go. That “oh” is brutal. It’s the trademark. It’s like a domestic abuse air raid siren. Ooooooh. Yo, I heard if you don’t pay child support for both your kids, that’s double jeopardy. They can’t get you on that one. You got to know your rights, brother. You got to know your rights. One of my friends overheard a guy in a 7-Eleven go, Damn it, Mikey spent all my sweatpants money on Doritos. What the f*ck does that mean? What could it possibly mean? Is the money in sweatpants? Is it for sweatpants? If it’s for sweatpants, why does your clothing cost as much as snacks? That’s my community, baby. Yeah, that’s— It’s a funny neighborhood, you know? It’s a bunch of those guys and then a bunch of, like, recent immigrants from South and Central America. And then a bunch of Greek people that are mad that immigrants are stealing their neighborhood. It’s a bunch of old Greek guys that are like, You know, they don’t even, they don’t even speak English. It’s like, Okay, man, you don’t speak English, right? What’s the issue? Yeah. It was a fun little immigrant upbringing over there. Any immigrants here? Yeah. Yeah? Nice. Where you from? Mexico. Mexico. Nice. Classic. Does that count here? Like this is Mexico, right? Like, it should be Mexico. But do you like your parents? Yeah. Yeah? Both of them? Both of them. Both? You don’t like one more than the other? The mom more than the dad. The mom more than dad. When’s the last time you and your dad hugged? Uhhh… We got him. Nah, it’s all good, dude. For me, me and my dad, It was the last time Greece got to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. That was— Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know if you guys know this. I don’t know if this is your experience, but immigrants, one of their favorite parenting techniques is child abuse. I don’t know if you guys knew that. Like, my dad didn’t hit us that much, but his go-to move was this, was just like. Do your f*cking homework. And to this day, he’ll be like, Well, come on, I never hit you. And it’s like, Yeah, but you always could have, you know? Never really felt off the table, Pops. I had a lot of friends from similar backgrounds. You know, I think you kind of attract that. And, you know, one of my buddies, we, we became really close later in life, and he’s still one of my best friends today. But when we were first friends, he was like opening up to me, you know? He was confiding in me and he was like, Yeah, dude. My dad used to just get f*cked up off wine coolers and beat the sh*t out of me. And, I knew it shouldn’t have tripped me up, but I was like, I’m sorry, dawg. You said wine coolers? Yeah. I just knew when I came home and I saw that daiquiri mix in the freezer I was in for a long night of being whipped with maraschino cherry stems. I didn’t get a lot of lessons from my dad. I’ll be honest. I didn’t, you know, he didn’t teach me a lot of stuff. I didn’t get a sex talk even. You know? The closest I got to a sex talk was one time, we were in Greece, and he was watching pornography just in the living room. Not, not in his chambers. Right? And it’s a James Bond-themed porno. And when James Bond starts getting sucked off, my dad looks at me. He’s like, Ehh? F*ckin’ ehh. And that was my sex talk. Just watching a British man get head with my father. Yeah, I’ll give him some credit, though. He was a really good dad when I was a little kid, you know? And then I think when I was like 10 or 11, he had a heart attack and he had one of those, like, near-death experience, moments of clarity. He was like, Oh my God, what have I been doing with my time on Earth? I have to start cheating on my wife. I can’t. I can’t be a present father. I have to buy a leather jacket from Costco and get pussy. Yeah, he cheated on my mom, and I don’t know how. Right? Like, if you’re some sexy rich guy, I get it. I don’t condone it, but I see what happened. What happened with my dad? Did some woman look at him and go, Oh, my God. When I saw that hunched-over Greek contractor take a piece of loose salami out of his pocket and eat it while laughing at a man in a wheelchair, I knew I had to have him. The w',\n",
       "  'ay his shoulder hair waved in the wind. Yeah. I don’t know. I’ve been going to therapy, though. You know? Any therapy heads in the building? Nice. What’s your biggest trauma? I’m kidding. No, I’m just a little light crowdwork, huh? No, I’ve been going to therapy a bunch, and I have empathy for my dumbass dad, you know? That suck, you know? Seeing it from his side, you know? Because, look, was he the best dad in the world? No. But did he do his best? Also no. But, you know, whatever, he gave it a hot 65%. He did— I’ll give him credit again. He gave me a better childhood than he had, right? That’s really all you can ask on some level. Like his family was all f*cked up. Here’s how my dad’s parents met. Right? This is Greece in the forties, right? It’s still arranged marriages. And no one in my grandfather’s village wants to marry him. Nobody. Doesn’t matter how many goats they throw in the trade. No one’s biting, right? No one in mainland Greece will marry him, which is actually kind of impressive, right? Like there’s no Internet. This is word of mouth spreading about what a piece of sh*t he is, right? Basically, what they end up doing is they catfish a family on an island eight hours away. Right? There’s no way for them to meet before the wedding. They do the deal through letters. Finally, it’s set. Everything’s good to go. They take this eight-hour boat ride out to this woman’s island. And the second my grandfather steps off the boat, the woman he’s supposed to marry looks at him and goes, No, absolutely not. I’m not, I’m not marrying this guy. And then her dad goes, Oh, geez, well, you came all this way. Why don’t you marry my other daughter? And those are my grandparents. That’s them. Wild, right? Have you had like a bad Craigslist roommate? And you’re like, Oh, once this lease is up, I am out of here. Imagine if that lease was your whole life and that roommate creampied you because that, that was my grandma’s life. And, yeah. You’d think something like that would make somebody a bitch. And you would be correct in this instance, actually. I feel bad and everything, but really a tough hang. I’ll be honest with you guys. I went to visit her actually on her deathbed, and she had pretty bad dementia by the time I got to see her. And I’m trying to communicate with her. And she just looks at me and she goes, Who are you? You got fatter. It’s like, okay, pick one. Okay? Either you don’t know who I am or you don’t know I got fatter. That’s how that works. But I got to hand it to her. You know, she snuck one in right at the buzzer. Three, two, one. You’re fat. [buzzer sound] One of the best to ever do it folks. Hang her moomoo up in the rafters. I like my family though. They are pretty funny. My mom’s mom is funny too. My grandma on the other side. She’s great. She’s very accepting, but very ignorant at the same time. Which is a really funny combo. Like over the holidays, a couple of years ago, we watched this old Greek movie, and one of the characters, it’s revealed, thinks Jews drink blood, you know? And it’s like an old movie. He’s the village idiot. It’s obviously a joke. Everyone’s making fun of him. Everybody’s laughing. I look at my family, they’re laughing. I look at my grandma. She’s like, confused. I am like, Oh, Grandma, isn’t this hilarious? This guy thinks Jews drink blood. And she’s like, Well, yeah, but. They do, right? But the way she said it was, And you shouldn’t judge other people’s cultures, Stavros. What? You think Jews are vampires? But we should let it slide for diversity reasons? Incredible perspective, yia-yia. She’s great. But I will say, the more time I spend around Greek people, the more time I think it’s crazy the kinds of immigrants we’re banning in this country. You know, like it should be us, right? Like, we got enough Europeans, right? Like a racist might be like, Oh, well, we can’t have refugees from the Middle East. What if they commit sex crimes? It’s like, okay, well, have you ever met an Italian man? Have you ever tried to purchase pizza in this country one time? Hey, bella, how old you are? That guy’s getting waved through customs. Why? F*ck. You know how Inuit people have, like, 30 words for “snow” in their language? Italian is similar in that they don’t have a single word for “consent” in theirs. No, I shouldn’t sh*t on Italians. I’m Greek. We’re basically Italians that peaked in high school, right? We’ve been coasting on democracy for quite some time now. It is a gorgeous place, though. I do love visiting over there. It f*cking rocks. I remember I took a visit there a couple of years ago with my girlfriend at the t',\n",
       "  'ime. And when you take an international trip like that with somebody, you learn a lot about each other. We’re gone for 10 days, just me and her. And what we learned is that we did not want to be together anymore. That was the big takeaway for us. Kind of tough, I’ll be honest with you, to break up on vacation, you know? That’s not how you see your chase Chase Sapphire Rewards going, you know? You ever paid $3,000 to be the saddest you’ve ever been? It was my fault, though. I took a rich girl on vacation. Right? Rich people don’t give a f*ck about vacations. Poor people, could you imagine breaking up on vacation? The only good week of your life? You’re not. You’re not doing that. But don’t get me wrong. She wasn’t like evil rich, right? She’s not space-for-fun rich. But I’ll put it this way. When the shampoo ran out in her home, they just threw the bottle away. Right? There was, there was no filling it with water and living off bubbles for a week, you know? She never had sh*tty bubbles hair. Right? There were no omelets for dinner, you know? Like, Whoa, hot dogs again? Mom’s the coolest! No buddy. Mom is not that cool. These are struggle dogs right here. We got to make these last till dad’s disability check comes in. Yeah, I don’t know if you know this, but making a pack of Hebrew Nationals last eight days, that’s actually white trash Hannukuh. Thanks. You know, it was a good relationship while it lasted. I’m not bitter. You know, things end. And we had a good time. We had a good sex life. You know, we were really into roleplaying. Anybody here? Roleplay? Nice. What do we do? Huh? Say it again. —Um, like schoolgirl. Schoolgirl. Classic. Very nice. Yeah, that’s good. Is this like teacher/schoolgirl or just like schoolgirl? Schoolgirl/schoolgirl. Schoolgirl/schoolgirl? Now we’re talking. Wow. A twist on an old classic. The Bud Light Lime of roleplaying. Nice. Hell yeah. I really like roleplaying because I always pick a guy that comes really fast. That’s my, that’s my character, is a guy that busts quick and then plays NBA2K for like a half hour. I really commit to that one. I’m sort of a method actor when it comes to that one. Yeah. I could tell, though, in hindsight that that relationship was kind of losing some steam. You know? I think you can tell in the way you initiate sex when the passion starts to go. You know, like when we first started dating, we’d go on these long dates, we’d talk for hours, there’d be a spark, we’d kiss. I’d be like, Wow, this is really gonna happen. The way I knew we were gonna have sex at the end of the relationship is, if I went to the bathroom and she was like, Wash your hands with soap this time! Like, hell yeah dude. Nice. Why’s she want ’em clean, huh? She’s not trying to get crumbs in there. That’s why. I’m about to have sex. It was good, though. I did— I learned a lot about myself being in a long-term relationship, you know? Like I learned I’m more traditional in some ways than I realize, even though I consider myself a feminist overall. You know? Like, do I want my girlfriend to shave her legs? Yes. But I will allow her to support me financially. So I’m sort of a modern guy in that sense. Thank you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Please. I’m just doing my part. Nah, I’m a feminist, though. You know, that part’s real. And I think my, my favorite part of feminism is the concept of mansplaining, you know, because basically that means men aren’t allowed to explain anything anymore, which means I could just be dumb as hell. Right? Like, if one of my friends, if she’s like, Hey, what’d you think of this book? I’d be like, Hm, nice try. I see what you’re up to, but I’m not reading anymore. I’m a feminist. Thank you very much. Yeah, but anyway, that relationship’s over. It’s been over for a while. I’ve just been out there. Just a fat little slut. Just f*cking— Thank you. Just toss this little weiner around town, you know what I mean? Just throwing this five-and-three-quarters everywhere, you know? Six on its tippy toes. Don’t worry. Was this summer as slutty as you guys thought it was gonna be? No, right? It wasn’t that good, right? Pissed me off. I was f*cking ready, dude. Everyone was building it up. Everyone was like, We’ve been locked up for a year. People are going crazy. They’re going to be sucking and f*cking in the streets, you know? That was not my experience, I have to be honest. I think what happened is everyone was very excited. Everybody was like, went out one time, got crazy, f*cked, and then looked around, and was like, This sh*t’s still pretty bad out here, actually. The president just has a different kind of dementia now.',\n",
       "  ' No one’s really fixed anything, but there’s less funny tweets now. Yeah. I was pissed. I was ready for this horny summer. Right? I grew my hair out for this sh*t, you know what I mean? I was bald when the pandemic started. I was like, F*ck it, let’s see what happens. I’m trying to get my sh*t tugged on, you know what I mean? But it didn’t happen, dude. I had big plans. I was going to get pegged by somebody’s wife on a hammock, you know? Some big naturals on my shoulders. But the best laid plans of mice and men. You know what I mean? I was having this conversation with my gay friends, right? I was talking about the summer and I was complaining and they’re like, What do you mean? You don’t have sex? We’re having sex all the time. That’s not fair, you guys. A gay guy making fun of a straight guy for not having enough sex, is like a Harlem Globetrotter making fun of an NBA player for not scoring enough points, you know? It’s like, Come on, man. No one plays defense in your league, right? A lot of, lot of showmanship. Yeah, a lot of confetti. But not a lot of fundamentals, is all I’m saying. Yeah, I don’t know, though. I’m 32. You know, maybe it’s time I started doing some gay sh*t, you know? Looks like fun, you know? Like no one’s ever come in my mouth, but I love an overeasy egg. How different could it really be? Be honest with yourselves right now. It’s probably pretty close. Throw a little Tabasco on the guy’s cock, you know what I mean? Take me to brunch, big dog. There’s some pissed off dudes in the crowd right now. Hard scrambled from now on! I will not have gay eggs! Nah, I don’t know. Maybe that’s a little far for me too, is uh, sucking a man off with hot sauce in my mouth. But I want to expand the sexual repertoire a little bit. You know, I want some new moves. I’ve been doing some different stuff. I’ve been doing the pineapple thing, you know? Supposed to make it taste better, but everybody hates it no matter how much pineapple I put in my foreskin. And I don’t— What? Just chunk after chunk. What am I doing wrong? That might be the stupidest thing I say tonight. Here’s my real move, though, you know, here. Here it is. Because I was always jealous when you’re hooking up with a girl, and then she puts your hair up, like, suggestively, and it’s like, Uh oh. You know what’s coming next. That’s why what I’ve been doing is when I’m hooking up with a girl and I’m about to go down on her, I take out a huge bib. Num num num num num num num. That’s my move. I better not hear about anybody in L.A. doing the bib. Okay? That’s mine. And you definitely cannot say “my compliments to the chef” afterwards. That ties it all together. But I’ve been out there. I’ve been dating a little bit. You know? I was dating mostly younger women, not on purpose. Just because no one my age wants to be with me, you know? Like I’m 32. Girls my age want, like, stability, you know, they want, like, a real job. Health insurance. I could get you mushrooms pretty easily, you know? Like, that’s a style of 30-year-old I am. I don’t know what an IRA is, but I have acid on me right now. Sometimes people are condescending if you date somebody younger. They’ll be like, Oh, I’m sure the conversation was very intellectually stimulating. And you know what? I’m very stupid. So, yeah, it was. I’m learning a lot from these girls, a lot about astrology, I’ll tell you that much. They love the stuff. Everyone’s pretty freaky now too, I realize. Everyone I feel like has to bust in a strange way, you know? Like a girl I was with recently wanted to be tied up and then also pretend she was sleeping. And it’s like, I could just go, you know what I mean? Like, if that’s what it’s going to take to f*ck me, I’ll head home. No hard feelings. I don’t want to sound like a prude. Right? I’m not trying to kink shame up here. Tying up’s fun. Even the sleeping, I guess I don’t have a problem with. My issue with that situation is that she has no use of her hands and I’ve never successfully had sex without the guiding vagina hand move. You know that move? Where the girl’s like an electrician trying to connect two wires. Just like a real— I 98% know where a pussy is, but that last 2% I really need help with. Yeah. I’m not that good at rough sex. I think it’s because I love my mom too much. She called me recently and she was like, Hey, how’s your love life going? It’s like, Not great, because of all the support you showed me as a child. Would it have killed you to miss a football practice every once in a while? I have no resentment towards women. I can barely choke this girl, mom. You’re embarrassing me right now.',\n",
       "  ' No, I’ll choke you, though. Don’t worry, I will. No problem. It’s not my favorite, but it’s fine. Some people, though, they love it, right? Some people, that’s how they have morning sex. That is crazy to me, right? There’s birds chirping outside. You’re smelling pancakes from next door. You’re just like— Come on, man. There’s a fresh morning dew outside. Children are going to school right now. Let “The Price Is Right” come on first. Show some decorum. Even dirty talk, you know? I feel like you’re doing me a really nice favor having sex with me. I don’t want to say a bunch of rude things to you, right? That’s not how you treat a bud doing a favor, right? Your friend helps you move. You’re not like, Yeah, get that ottoman, you little slut. Just putting my fingers in my friend Jeff’s mouth. Pick up the credenza, Jeffy. [spit sound] You little mover. Here’s another move somebody asked me to pull, was one of these, was just a choke-finger combo. You know, just like a real— Is that is that still sex, you guys? I got to be honest, it didn’t feel like sex. It felt like gynecology in the 1400s, you know? Like I felt like I was punishing a witch more than anything. It felt like we caught her learning how to read. For the crime of female literacy. Little Pilgrim hat. If she’s squirts, she’s a witch. Yeah. I’ve been out there, you know? I’ve been on some sexual voyages, you know? You know, I’ve had to f*ck my way out of a couple jams. Had a couple threesomes, Didn’t all go my way, I’ll be honest with you guys. Anybody here? A threesome? Yeah? How’d it go? —Uh, it went pretty well, I guess. Pretty well, you guess? Alright. Nice. Who were these people? —I got hit up on Tinder like four in the morning. You got hit up on Tinder. By a woman’s account? A man’s account? —Yeah, a woman surprisingly enough. A woman at 4 a.m. Alright, nice. Just out of the blue, they’re like, This is the guy I need. Huh? —She said, Do you want to have a threesome? Wow. —I did not think it was real. Sure. Of course. You’re like, yeah. You’re just like, alright, just check— Make sure my kidney is here the next morning. —It’s like a 30-minute Uber ride. —I was like, this might be it. That is— You weren’t getting too much pussy before, I’m guessing, right? They caught you in a drought. They caught you in a big dry spell. You’re like, I could die. It’s 4 a.m. I have to work in the morning. It’s $75 right now. But by gum, I might just get double sucked, so. And who are these women? What are they looking like when you get in? Do the pictures look similar? Wow. —Yeah. Wow. —It was all pretty cut and dry. All pretty cut and dry. Like you’re f*cking hanging, like you’re doing shingles on their roof. You’re like, Yeah. Wasn’t too much water damage? Everything was looking pretty good. Get in and out job. Alright. So how quickly until you’re in the house, is your penis breathing fresh air, would you say? —Like an hour and a half. Hour and a half? So you warmed up a little bit. That’s nice. —Except they wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna kill them. —I was like, —Right. Yeah. —I’m the one that took an Uber ride —Sure, sure, sure. —30 minutes away. Wow, it’s a Mexican standoff. Okay. And then after they’ve vetted you for 90 minutes, they’re like, This is good. We can f*ck this guy. Okay. And then, is it good? Did everybody bust? —Just not me. Just not you? What? Get the f*ck out of here. The rare the guy doesn’t come in a two girls, one guy? They gave me a f*ckload of Adderall. They gave you Adderall? What the f*ck is going on? Wow. Respect to these girls. Did they give you dick pills and Adderall? That’s a f*cking dangerous combination. And you don’t bust and you’re just f*cking, you’re driving— You’re taking a f*cking 40-minute Uber home. You’re like— Dick on titanium, just— That was pretty cool. And you know what? That’s a fond memory for you, isn’t it? You’re gonna be on your deathbed just like smiling. Your grandchild is gonna be like, What is it, Papa? And you’re gonna be thinking about not busting to two, I’m gonna guess Maryland five and a halfs. There’s no way— There’s no way these were hot women, right? Everything we know we can kind of through echolocation understand they were ugly. And you’re going to be thinking about not coming with these women. Then you’re gonna look at him and be like, How much I love grandma. That’s— Nice, how about a nice hand for our friend over here, huh? Anybody else? Any other threesomes? This seems like a pretty— Over here. Raising your glass? Is that the I-had-a-threesome salute? How’d it go? —Not too well. Not too well? Yeah. By the way, shouts out a fellow ma',\n",
       "  'n of size, getting his dick sucked by two women. Who were these— What was the situation for you? —They looked like you. They looked like me. Alright. I don’t know why the f*ck I have to be disparaged in this. And you’re the one who f*cked them. I look like me. You f*cked two people that looked like me. How am I? How am I getting dragged into this? You couldn’t have said they looked like you? You know what I’m saying? Listen, we’re not too far off, pal. There’s a lot of different ways you could have phrased that that doesn’t throw me under the bus. Okay, so you were having a threesome in your weight class. It sounds like this was more of a wrestling match than a sexual encounter. Where did you meet these people? —Vegas. Vegas. Nice. Okay, so just three people down on their luck, just deciding to try to have a plus-sized threeway. That’s good. That’s good for the community. I like that. How many people came for you? —Only me. Only— Oh there we go. We’ve got the yin and yang of bad threesomes over here. I love it. Yeah. Mine was— Mine was closer to yours than his. But I’ll tell my story now. My threesome did not go good either. It was a surprise, first of all. I didn’t think it was gonna happen. And also, the day of my threesome, it started with a $40 Chinese food order. That was breakfast for me. You know what I mean? Just me, by the way. That’s $40 me. And it was one of those things where I was waiting. It was like, 10:59, 11. Hello? Yes, I’d like to— It’s like ordering Chinese food, like I’m waiting for Star Wars, you know? And so $40 Chinese food breakfast. There’s a real ceiling to your day when that’s how it starts, right? And I was also coming off the heels of a tender bender, which is when you have chicken tenders every day for two weeks in a row. Right? So I’m not where you need to be, nutritionally speaking, for a threesome, right? So I’m actually scrolling on Tinder and she’s gonna come to my show that night, but she’s bringing a friend. So in my mind, I’m like, okay, she’s coming to a public place. She’s bringing a friend, she wants to check out the vibes. And if you know, if the vibes are right, maybe we go on a date next week, just me and her. Maybe we f*ck next week, right? But there’s no sexual pressure on this situation. I just have to be a cute, charming little guy, and I think we all know how that’s gonna go. Right? So we get there and it’s a fun time. You know, the conversation is going really well. Her friend’s cool. She’s cool. And but, you know, like I said, I don’t think I’m gonna f*ck so I’m gonna keep eating, right? Because it’s one or the other, folks. I got a real problem. And so we’re chatting and I’m just f*cking eating like an asshole. I’m eating the way like a cartoon villain eats, you know what I mean? I’m just like, they’re talking just like sliders, like— You know? Just like a fish. The bones come out, like that situation. And it’s going good, but I’m getting sleepy because I’ve had a lot of carbs, right? And I’m about to talk to the girl I match with and be like, Hey, this was fun, let’s hang out some other time. But before I can make that pitch, I look over at them and they’re being really weird. They’re like texting each other. And I’m like, Hey, girls, what’s going on? And they’re like, Oh, nothing. We were thinking like, maybe we should all go back to my place and f*ck. And I was like, Yeah. Yes. Ha ha ha. Duh. That’s what I was also thinking. That’s what I am prepared for right now. But what am I gonna do? What, I’m gonna be like, My tummy hurts. I can’t get pussy. I had too many treats to get pussy tonight. I can’t do that. Right? So I’m like, F*ck it, I’m gonna thug this out. We’ll be fine. So we’re driving back to their place, right? And the whole time I’m doing this thing, I don’t know fellas if you’ve ever done this, where you try and make your dick hard with your mind. Have you ever done that? Just do a little check-in, I’m just in there like, Nothing. No movement whatsoever. Right? But I’m like, no big deal. I’m gonna get in this room. It’s gonna be me and four titties. I’m gonna be good to go. Right? And at first, I’m right. At first it rocks. I’m in there. Just me and four titties. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen— Have you seen one of those videos where they give a baby hearing aids for the first time? You ever, You ever see one of those? I’m just in there like— I’m having the time of my life, brother. It’s going awesome. But then, very quickly, the Chinese food comes back to haunt me, right? I just, I’m hitting them with dumpling dick, you know? Just think of a couple soup dumplings stacked on top of',\n",
       "  ' each other, you know? Very wobbly. Like, optically, I’m hard, but there is no structural integrity to my penis whatsoever. Yeah, it’s tough. I’m doing this movie a lot. I’m doing the okay sign. Have you ever done that? Where it’s like, Yeah, no, it’s hard. Uh huh, yeah. No, it’s hard. It’s actually definitely hard. Can you check? Can you check again? My dick is hard for sure. Like my credit card is getting declined. I’m like, Yeah, I called my bank. They said my dick was hard. So can you check? I’m blowing it, dude. I’m stalling for so— I’m eating pussy for so long. You could have just watched all of Rush Hour 2 the amount of time I’m eating pussy. One of them just falls asleep in the middle of it, you know? You know you’re not laying it down when you lose a participant mid-threesome, right? Yeah. I’m like, this is brutal. This is horrific. We got to end this. So I guess what I’m gonna have to do is jack off and leave. And that’s what I did. And in hindsight, it’s crazy that was my plan, right? Why the f*ck did I do that? Like, Oh, hey, girls, I’ve just been sexually disappointing you for two hours in a row. I’m gonna make a small mess in your home and get out of here. If that’s alright with you. And it was an angry one, too. It was one of those get the poison outs. You know? It was like a real, Aaaaah. I want to be free! So I do that and I’m just standing in this f*cking hallway dealing with a devastating bout of post-nut clarity. And I’m like, Wow, this is it. This is a tough L. This is the worst one of my life, probably. But you know what? That’s okay, because we can rebuild from this, right? It’s only up from here. This is rock bottom. So I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna f*cking rebuild my life like the, like the Phoenix, I’ll rise from these sexual ashes. Right? And that’s what I do. Eight months go by, my sh*t’s going great. My life’s going better and better and better. Things are going really good. And then out of the blue, I get a text from these girls and they’re like, Hey, want to f*ck again? And I’m like, This is a prank. Right? Like, I’m gonna get to their apartment. It’s just gonna be all my enemies, you know? Ha ha ha dude, we knew you couldn’t fuck. Ha ha ha. But that wasn’t, it was really them. They wanted to hook up again. And I wasn’t gonna ask too many questions, right? They had a whole little plan. You know, they had the day off from work. They were gonna go to the museum and then come over to my place after, which is a very European afternoon, you know? Like look at paintings and f*ck a fat guy with a little mustache. That’s, that’s Parisian, you know what I mean? And I had a plan too. I wasn’t going out the same way. This is redemption, you know what I mean? I’m f*cking hitting the elliptical. I’m f*cking drinking green juices. I’m drinking kombuchas. I buy $80 worth of illegal Indian Viagra off the Internet. Just from a guy that worked at a research lab. He was like, Yeah, just Venmo me and put “lunch.” Just comes in an unmarked vial. I’m just like, I take so much of it and my dick— it worked. My dick got hard as sh*t. But the rest of my body was failing, you know? Like, I was just f*cking and my joints were locking up. I’m just in there cold sweat, you know? Like the eyesight of my left eye is flickering like a light bulb in a haunted house. And I’m like, This is it. This is how I deserve to die. Is overdosing on dick pills. And if that’s how I went, I wouldn’t even want an open casket, you know? I would want a gloryhole casket, you know? Just everyone coming, paying their last respects, you know? He was such a good boy. Yeah. And so obviously the threesome wasn’t good, but there was one good part in the beginning, and that’s when I was I was eating pussy while getting my dick sucked. And it felt like I was sucking my own dick through a portal and that, that was the best moment of my life, I gotta be honest. Guys, thank you so much. That’s it. We did it. Hell yeah. Thank you.
